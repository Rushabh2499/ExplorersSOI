Adelaide,North Terrace,"
A handsome tree-lined boulevard graced by historic and cultural treasures, North Terrace is a great place to kick off a city tour. Parliament House, at the intersection of King William Street and North Terrace, is perhaps the most imposing building in Adelaide with its monumental colonnade. Just down the street, cheek by cheek, the State Library of South Australia, the South Australian Museum, and the Art Gallery of South Australia offer a triple dose of art and culture and are three of the city's top attractions. Bordering these, the main campus of the University of Adelaide hosts the Mitchell Building, one of the city's finest examples of Gothic Revival style. Other North Terrace treasures include the Migration Museum, Ayer's Historic House, and the Adelaide Botanic Garden, a green thumb's dream.","['//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1e/Adelaide%27s_North_Terrace_facing_west.jpg/670px-Adelaide%27s_North_Terrace_facing_west.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/37/North_Terrace_looking_east%2C_summer_2010.jpg/600px-North_Terrace_looking_east%2C_summer_2010.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/79/Adelaide_nth_tce1.8.jpg/600px-Adelaide_nth_tce1.8.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/92/Nth_tce.jpg/600px-Nth_tce.jpg, '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/83/Adelaide_nth_tce2.2.jpg/600px-Adelaide_nth_tce2.2.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6d/Buildings_on_North_Terrace%2C_Adelaide.jpg/620px-Buildings_on_North_Terrace%2C_Adelaide.jpg']",https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d3271.411579540987!2d138.60260481495868!3d-34.921213381872626!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x6ab0c92cb874ff2d%3A0x464f6e42aeb00ced!2sNorth%20Terrace%2C%20Adelaide%20SA%2C%20Australia!5e0!3m2!1sen!2sin!4v1601333181871!5m2!1sen!2sin,"['InterContinental Adelaide', 'Stamford Plaza Adelaide', 'The Playford Adelaide - MGallery', 'ibis Styles Adelaide Grosvenor', 'Oaks Adelaide Horizons Suites']","['South Australian Museum', 'Adelaide Botanic Garden', 'Palm House', 'Hindley Street, Adelaide', 'Ayers House Museum']","['Parlamento', 'La Boca Bar and Grill Adelaide', 'The Playford Restaurant', 'Ginza Miyako Japanese Restaurant', 'Golden Boy']",
Adelaide,Adelaide Botanic Garden,"
Wander through the wrought-iron gates at the east end of North Terrace and enter a wonderland of botanical treasures. Established in 1855, Adelaide Botanic Garden features educational themed plantings such as medicinal plants, a Mediterranean garden, Australian native species, and a wetland designed to sequester enough water to eventually irrigate the entire grounds. The Santos Museum of Economic Botany provides insight on the important role plants play in everyday life through a series of permanent collections. Other garden favorites include the palm house, the Bicentennial Conservatory with lowland rainforest plants, night-flowering Amazonica water lilies, and Australia's oldest avenue of Moreton Bay fig trees. Exploring these beautiful gardens is one of the best things to do in Adelaide for free. Mount Lofty Botanic Garden is also worth a visit to see its impressive collection of cool climate plants and heritage rose garden.","['//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/81/Palm_house%2C_Adelaide_Botanic_Gardens_-_oblique.JPG', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/ca/Palm-Tropical_house_at_the_Adelaide_Botanic_gardens.JPG', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a4/Palm_House_-_Botanic_Gardens_Adelaide.JPG', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d0/Rose_garden_at_the_Adelaide_Botanic_Garden.JPG', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/27/Adelaide_Botanic_Gardens_Bicentennial_conservatory.JPG']",https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d3271.5650558517036!2d138.6078031149585!3d-34.91736308166726!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x6ab0c932e6844093%3A0x3680a76fbc1557a8!2sAdelaide%20Botanic%20Garden!5e0!3m2!1sen!2sin!4v1601333677019!5m2!1sen!2sin,"['Majestic Roof Garden Hotel', 'Holiday Inn Express Adelaide City Centre', 'Pullman Adelaide', 'ibis Adelaide', 'Crowne Plaza Adelaide']","['Palm House', 'Bicentennial Conservatory', 'Botanic Park', 'Adelaide Zoo', 'Garden of Health']",['Botanic Gardens Restaurant'],
Adelaide,Adelaide Oval,"
Stadiums aren't always a top attraction in a capital city, but Aussies love their sports, and this venue is an important part of the city's history. Sitting in the center of Adelaide's attractive Riverbank Precinct, the stadium was established in 1871 and hosted its first test cricket match in 1884. Since its founding, the stadium has played host to more than 16 different sports, including AFL, archery, cycling, hockey, lacrosse, and tennis, as well as music concerts and major events. A multi-million-dollar renovation completed in 2014 revitalized the venue, but it still features the old heritage-listed scoreboard and century-old Moreton Bay fig trees. If you have time, try to buy tickets for a sporting match or event here. Cricket fans should make a beeline for the Bradman Museum to see memorabilia on the life of Australia's most famous cricketer.","['//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/78/Adelaide_city_centre_view_crop.jpg/600px-Adelaide_city_centre_view_crop.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/75/Ausvsnz_08_adelaide_scoreboard.jpg/600px-Ausvsnz_08_adelaide_scoreboard.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d8/Adelaide_Oval_2006.jpg/650px-Adelaide_Oval_2006.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/85/Completed_Adelaide_Oval_2014_-_cropped_and_rotated.jpg/650px-Completed_Adelaide_Oval_2014_-_cropped_and_rotated.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/91/Packed_Adelaide_Oval.jpg/650px-Packed_Adelaide_Oval.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/72/Adelaide_Oval_%2823183793744%29.jpg/250px-Adelaide_Oval_%2823183793744%29.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7c/Adelaide_Oval_-_panoramio.jpg/750px-Adelaide_Oval_-_panoramio.jpg']",https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d3271.6388410364734!2d138.59392591495848!3d-34.91551188156853!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x6ab0c8d4d4172617%3A0xfa2382af4af8e237!2sAdelaide%20Oval!5e0!3m2!1sen!2sin!4v1601334365824!5m2!1sen!2sin,"['InterContinental Adelaide', 'Holiday Inn Express Adelaide City Centre', 'Oval Hotel', 'Stamford Plaza Adelaide', 'ibis Styles Adelaide Grosvenor']","['The Bradman Collection', 'RoofClimb Adelaide Oval']","['Five Regions Restaurant', 'Malt Shovel Taphouse Adelaide', 'Koffee Ink', 'Parlamento', 'Riverside Restaurant']",
Adelaide,South Australian Museum,"
The South Australian Museum, adjacent to the State Library, is a top research facility renowned for its Aboriginal heritage collections. In addition to the excellent Australian collection, you can admire artifacts from the South Pacific Islands in the permanent Pacific Cultures Gallery, gaze upon Egyptian antiquities, and learn about local flora and fauna in the South Australian Biodiversity Gallery. Children love the natural history exhibits with stuffed specimens, fossils, and skeletons, and special exhibits mean there's always something new to see. Best of all, this museum is one of the many things to do for free in this culture-rich city.","['//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/77/22042010_SA_Museum.jpg','//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a5/Sa_museum.jpg/620px-Sa_museum.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/77/22042010_SA_Museum.jpg/620px-22042010_SA_Museum.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cf/SouthAustralianMuseum.jpg/620px-SouthAustralianMuseum.jpg']",https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d3271.441631814621!2d138.60102801495862!3d-34.92045948183233!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x6ab0ced5b5365917%3A0xd832d032672eae2a!2sSouth%20Australian%20Museum!5e0!3m2!1sen!2sin!4v1601334901852!5m2!1sen!2sin,"['ibis Adelaide', 'Holiday Inn Express Adelaide City Centre', 'InterContinental Adelaide', 'Hotel Richmond', 'Pullman Adelaide']","['Art Gallery of South Australia', 'Migration Museum', 'State Library of South Australia', 'National War Memorial', 'Adelaide Zoo']","['Museum Cafe', 'Art Gallery Food + Wine', ""Culshaw's Restaurant"", 'The Logical Indian', 'Africola']",
Adelaide,State Library Of South Australia,"
The State Library of South Australia surprises first-time visitors with its dramatic juxtaposition of old and new. The contemporary Spence Wing with its sharp lines and glass-fronted entrance offers modern facilities and free Wi-Fi. From here, ask for directions to the original library, housed in the adjacent 1884 French Renaissance building known as the Mortlock Wing. Entering this grand old space is like stepping back in time. Multi-tiered galleries beckon high above, edged by elaborate wrought iron balustrades, and ladders reach up to leather-bound books neatly propped in the wooden shelves. Highlighting this flashback to libraries of old is a stream of natural light flooding through the glass dome in the roof. The Mortlock Wing is also worth a visit for its special collection of works on the history of South Australia.","['//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/88/State_Library_of_South_Australia_-_entrance.JPG','//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fc/AdelaideOldStateLibraryAug08.jpg/620px-AdelaideOldStateLibraryAug08.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/94/AdelaideMortlockLibraryAug08.jpg/620px-AdelaideMortlockLibraryAug08.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b3/Mortlock_Wing%2C_State_Library_of_South_Australia.jpg/620px-Mortlock_Wing%2C_State_Library_of_South_Australia.jpg']",https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d3271.438654117601!2d138.6004387149587!3d-34.92053418183639!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x6ab0ced45e17ea3b%3A0xbe6b5524efd4897d!2sState%20Library%20of%20South%20Australia!5e0!3m2!1sen!2sin!4v1601335359767!5m2!1sen!2sin,"['ibis Adelaide', 'Holiday Inn Express Adelaide City Centre', 'Stamford Plaza Adelaide', 'Hotel Richmond', 'InterContinental Adelaide']",['State Library of South Australia'],['State Library of South Australia'],
Adelaide,Glenelg,"
In the sheltered and surf-free Gulf St. Vincent, the seaside village of Glenelg is a popular escape from the hustle and bustle of the city. To get here, most visitors opt for the 25-minute trip on Adelaide's only surviving tram, which departs from Victoria Square in the city center. As well as its beach appeal and many tourist attractions, Glenelg has a fascinating history. The first group of free settlers disembarked from HMS Buffalo in Holdfast Bay here, making this the oldest European settlement on mainland South Australia. Sidewalk cafés, boutique hotels, and lively summer entertainment create a holiday feel, and tourists will find plenty of family-friendly attractions. Kids can catch their thrills at The Beachouse, an amusement park packed with rides, including a giant waterslide, bumper boats, and Ferris wheel. Those seeking a quieter visit can bask on the beach or cast a fishing line off the pier. Sailing and swimming with dolphins are other popular activities.","['//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/45/Glenelg_Beach_in_summer.jpg/670px-Glenelg_Beach_in_summer.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a0/Glenelg_marina_South_Australia.jpg/620px-Glenelg_marina_South_Australia.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/65/Glenelg_Foreshore_South_Australia.jpg/900px-Glenelg_Foreshore_South_Australia.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b2/Glenelg_Marina_South_Australia.jpg/900px-Glenelg_Marina_South_Australia.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3a/Brighton_Jetty.jpg']",https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d13076.302070114112!2d138.50537083004411!3d-34.9797731042986!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x6ab0db3e6e3473c1%3A0x74a7b5ee5a4241ad!2sGlenelg%20Beach!5e0!3m2!1sen!2sin!4v1601336207989!5m2!1sen!2sin,"['Stamford Grand Adelaide Hotel', 'Oaks Glenelg Plaza Pier Suites', 'Atlantic Tower Motor Inn', 'Glenelg Motel', 'Oaks Glenelg Liberty Suites']","['Bay Discovery Centre', 'Jetty Road, Glenelg', 'Colley Reserve', 'Jimmy Melrose Park', 'Old Gum Tree Reserve']","['Broadway Hotel', 'The Promenade Restaurant', 'The Strand Cafe Restaurant', 'The Wharf', ""Cardone's Seafood & Grill""]",
Adelaide,Adelaide Festival Centre,"
A five-minute walk from North Terrace and Rundle Mall, the Adelaide Festival Centre was Australia's first multi-functional arts venue and excites both locals and tourists with its lively cultural calendar. Its white tent-like roof structure is a distinctive landmark along the River Torrens. In addition to the large 2,000-seat Festival Theatre, the venue is home to several smaller theaters, a banquet room, light-filled gallery, and an amphitheater for concerts and recitals.

Brisbane,River Cruises,"
The most scenic and exciting way to travel around Brisbane is by CityCat. Gliding the twists and turns of the Brisbane River seven days a week, the fleet of CityCats and City Ferries with 24 hop-on, hop-off terminals offer a range of different cruises, many with informative narration about the history and sights of the city. From the magnificent University of Queensland to the North Shore, the route takes in redeveloped industrial sites, riverside mansions, bridges, and parklands. This is an excellent way to gain a fresh perspective of Brisbane landmarks such as the Story bridge, Kangaroo Point Cliffs, and even some of the wildlife, like the fruit bats that gather along the mangroves on the riverbank. You can also hop aboard a Miramar Cruise to Lone Pine Koala Sanctuary.

Brisbane,Moreton Island,"
Easily accessible via a 75-minute ferry ride from downtown Brisbane, Moreton Island is the perfect day trip. As the world's third largest sand island and with more than 98 percent of the island designated as national park, Moreton Island is one of Queensland's best-kept secrets. Lush vegetation frames azure waters that lap the pure-white sandy beaches. Popular things to do here include diving and snorkeling the many shallow-water wrecks; feeding wild dolphins at the Tangalooma Island Resort; quad biking; and water sports, such as whale-watching cruises, fishing, and sea kayaking. Sandboarding and 4WD adventures are also popular. While you're here, try to visit Cape Moreton Lighthouse for beautiful ocean views.","['//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6e/Moreton_Island_panorama.jpg/800px-Moreton_Island_panorama.jpg', '//www.australia.com/content/australia/en/places/brisbane-and-surrounds/guide-to-moreton-island/jcr:content/hero/desktop.adapt.1920.high.jpg', '//tul.imgix.net/content/article/Moreton_Island_Tourism_QLD.jpg?auto=format,compress&w=740&h=486&fit=crop', '//imageresizer.static9.net.au/R6ZOGfoPfvi7bBQne_CyT62MknU=/1200x0/https%3A%2F%2Fprod.static9.net.au%2F_%2Fmedia%2F2017%2F07%2F11%2F13%2F24%2FiStock646196084.jpg']",https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d227129.37509847846!2d153.27467773202295!3d-27.190990035418206!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x6b93c8b582fcfb0d%3A0x6c4ab37ba534e1f9!2sMoreton%20Island!5e0!3m2!1sen!2sin!4v1601341604261!5m2!1sen!2sin,"['Tangalooma Island Resort', 'Moreton Island Accommodation Bali House', 'Allure Resort Stradbroke Island', 'Kookaburra Lodge Hotel', 'Villas at Tangalooma']","['Tangalooma Island Resort', 'Moreton Island National Park', 'Adventure Moreton Island', 'Moreton Island']","['Moreton Island Adventures', 'Tangalooma Island Resort Ferry Terminal', 'Moreton Bay Boat Club', 'Rangla Punjab Indian Restaurant - Bribie Island', 'Tangalooma Island Resort']",
Canberra,Australian War Memorial,"
Inaugurated in the middle of WWII, the massive Byzantine-style monument commemorating Australia's war fatalities is Canberra's most poignant attraction. More than just a war memorial, the site combines an excellent museum, archives, art gallery, and library. The Commemorative Courtyard at the entrance to the memorial is a haunting introduction. Inscribed in bronze on the walls of the colonnades are the names of every Australian who has died in war since 1885, and the length of the list is spine chilling. Beyond the entrance, different galleries retrace the stories of Australia's armed conflicts from colonial days to the present. The exhibits are constantly evolving, but highlights include the collection of old aircraft and the child-friendly Discovery Zone packed with interactive displays. If possible, you should set aside several hours to appreciate this thought-provoking memorial, and if you're visiting near the end of the day, try to stay for the Last Post, a moving tribute to the fallen played at 4:55pm daily.","['//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/50/AWM_canberra_1.jpg/670px-AWM_canberra_1.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/84/Lone_Pine_at_the_AWM.jpg/620px-Lone_Pine_at_the_AWM.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2d/AWM_Canberra_Dawn_25APR05.jpg/620px-AWM_Canberra_Dawn_25APR05.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f5/2013-04-25_AWM_Anzac_Dawn_-_Ben_Roberts-Smith_VC.jpg/620px-2013-04-25_AWM_Anzac_Dawn_-_Ben_Roberts-Smith_VC.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b0/Australian_War_Memorial_courtyard.jpg/620px-Australian_War_Memorial_courtyard.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/78/Remembrance_Nature_Park.jpg/620px-Remembrance_Nature_Park.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fd/Anzac_Parade_Canberra_2014-09-16.jpg/620px-Anzac_Parade_Canberra_2014-09-16.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cd/SIMPSON_AND_HIS_DONKEY_MONUMENT.jpg/620px-SIMPSON_AND_HIS_DONKEY_MONUMENT.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c1/AWM_Western_Front_Gallery_August_2012.JPG', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f9/Kangaroos_against_Gun_Turret.JPG']",https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d3256.9193175515497!2d149.14464251497122!3d-35.28313220126853!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x6b164d76cb4004ef%3A0x41ef86ae38d42ce6!2sAustralian%20War%20Memorial!5e0!3m2!1sen!2sin!4v1601351443705!5m2!1sen!2sin,"['Mercure Canberra', 'Crowne Plaza Canberra', 'Novotel Canberra', 'Canberra City YHA', 'Avenue Hotel Canberra']","['Australian War Memorial', 'Australian War Memorial', 'Australian Army Memorial, Canberra', 'Australian Vietnam Forces National Memorial']","[""Poppy's Cafe""]",
Canberra,New Parliament House,"
The final fulfillment of architect Walter Burley Griffin's vision for Canberra in 1912, New Parliament House is a marvel of modern architecture. The boomerang-shaped structure nestles comfortably into Capital Hill and was designed to replace the Provisional Parliament House at the base of the hill, now known as Old Parliament House. A New York-based architect won an international competition for the design of the new building, and on May 9, 1988, the Queen officially opened Parliament House. The date in May was chosen to commemorate the first meeting of Federal Parliament in Melbourne in 1901 and the first meeting of Parliament in the Old Parliament House in 1927. From the expansive grassed walkway, which forms the roof, visitors can enjoy panoramic views of Canberra and see how Parliament forms the central focus of the city's street layout. Architectural highlights of the building include the two huge circular walls composed of granite, which mirror the curves of the hill; the towering 81-meter flagpole; and the Ceremonial Pool. In the foyer, 48 columns of illuminated greenish-gray marble create the impression of a eucalyptus forest. Throughout the public spaces, exhibits display important documents (the Magna Carta is a highlight) and retrace important events in Australian history. From the gallery running around the first floor, you can gain admission to the public galleries of the green-hued House of Representatives, and the Senate, traditionally dressed in red. A visit during sitting times is a great way to view first-hand how parliament functions, and the free guided tours offer fascinating details about the building. After visiting, you can take the 3.5-kilometer Parliament House Walk to the city center and learn about the Parliamentary Triangle along the way through interpretive signs.","['//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b6/Parliament_House_at_dusk%2C_Canberra_ACT.jpg/640px-Parliament_House_at_dusk%2C_Canberra_ACT.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0f/Ac.parlthousemelb.jpg/620px-Ac.parlthousemelb.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c9/CSIRO_ScienceImage_11533_Parliament_House_Canberra.jpg/620px-CSIRO_ScienceImage_11533_Parliament_House_Canberra.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/21/Opening_parliament_house_1988.jpg/620px-Opening_parliament_house_1988.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Parliament_House%2C_Canberra%2C_Pano_jjron_25.9.2008-edit1.jpg/800px-Parliament_House%2C_Canberra%2C_Pano_jjron_25.9.2008-edit1.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/97/Great_Hall_-_Parliament_of_Australia.jpg/620px-Great_Hall_-_Parliament_of_Australia.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/24/Australian_House_of_Representatives_-_Parliament_of_Australia.jpg/620px-Australian_House_of_Representatives_-_Parliament_of_Australia.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/46/Australian_House_of_Representatives_centre_desk%2C_Hansard_and_dispatch_boxes_-_Parliament_of_Australia.jpg/620px-Australian_House_of_Representatives_centre_desk%2C_Hansard_and_dispatch_boxes_-_Parliament_of_Australia.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a3/Australian_Senate_-_Parliament_of_Australia.jpg/620px-Australian_Senate_-_Parliament_of_Australia.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d2/Senate_panorama.jpg/620px-Senate_panorama.jpg']",https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d3255.909935635202!2d149.12220361497214!3d-35.30821930261949!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x6b164cdf8ec43c99%3A0x567943f526daa249!2sParliament%20House!5e0!3m2!1sen!2sin!4v1601352097002!5m2!1sen!2sin,"['Hyatt Hotel Canberra - A Park Hyatt Hotel', 'Burbury Hotel Canberra', 'Rydges Canberra', 'Hotel Realm', 'Forrest Hotel and Apartments']","['Parliament House', 'Old Parliament House']","[""Queen's Terrace Cafe"", 'Parliament House', 'Terrace Cafe', 'Old Parliament House', 'Vincent Restaurant']",
Canberra,Lake Burley Griffin,"
Beautiful Lake Burley Griffin is the centerpiece of Canberra. Named for the city's architect, this artificial lake was included in his original plan of 1912, but didn't come to fruition until 1958. Tourists and locals alike come here to bike and stroll along the waterfront paths; picnic along its park-fringed shores; and fish, sail, or paddle the glistening waters. Six islands lie at its center, the largest of which is Aspen Island, home to the National Carillon, a gift from the British government with 55 bronze bells. Sprinkled around the lake are some of Canberra's top things to see and do, including the National Gallery, National Library, Questacon, and National Museum. Standing on the shores of the central basin, you can see the Captain Cook Memorial Jet, a 147-meter-high fountain inaugurated in 1970 on the 200th anniversary of Cook's discovery of Australia. A globe sculpture depicting the path of Cook's voyages lies on the shores of the lake at Regatta Point. On the north side of the lake, Commonwealth Park contains play areas, paddling pools, waterfalls, an amphitheater, and a path round the park. In spring, the park is the venue for the famous Floriade festival, a celebration of spring when more than a million flowers are in bloom.","['//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/23/Lake_Burley_Griffin_From_Black_Mountain_Tower_%28cropped%29.jpg/650px-Lake_Burley_Griffin_From_Black_Mountain_Tower_%28cropped%29.jpg','//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/36/Scrivener_Dam_-_Lightened.jpg/600px-Scrivener_Dam_-_Lightened.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9a/Autumn_on_Lake_Burley_Griffin.jpg/620px-Autumn_on_Lake_Burley_Griffin.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1a/Captain_Cook_Memorial.jpg/620px-Captain_Cook_Memorial.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/19/View_from_telstra_tower_at_sunset.jpg/620px-View_from_telstra_tower_at_sunset.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a3/Commonwealth_Park_in_Canberra.jpg/620px-Commonwealth_Park_in_Canberra.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b9/Catamaran_LBG.jpg/670px-Catamaran_LBG.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f6/National_Carillon%2C_ACT_-_Rectilinear_projection.jpg/670px-National_Carillon%2C_ACT_-_Rectilinear_projection.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8c/Lake_burley_griffin04.jpg/620px-Lake_burley_griffin04.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b5/Southern_view_of_Canberra_from_Mount_Ainslie_lookout.jpg/1700px-Southern_view_of_Canberra_from_Mount_Ainslie_lookout.jpg']",https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d52100.52387683695!2d149.0771409462389!3d-35.29895540101178!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x6b164d2ec5057d73%3A0x2a00ea6ecc9ad6b0!2sLake%20Burley%20Griffin!5e0!3m2!1sen!2sin!4v1601352482562!5m2!1sen!2sin,"['Hyatt Hotel Canberra - A Park Hyatt Hotel', 'Peppers Gallery Hotel Canberra', 'Forrest Hotel and Apartments', 'BreakFree Capital Tower Canberra', 'Burbury Hotel Canberra']","['National Carillon', 'Lake Burley Griffin', 'Questacon - National Science and Technology Centre', 'National Museum of Australia', 'Magna Carta Place']","['Southern Cross Yacht Club', 'The Boat House', ""Water's Edge Restaurant"", '7 by the Lake', 'The Promenade Cafe']",

Canberra,National Library of Australia,"
Opened in 1968, the National Library of Australia is a treasure trove of Australian books, manuscripts, newspapers, historic documents, oral history, music, and pictures. Its most valuable possessions are Captain Cook's journal (1768-71) and Wills' diary of his expedition with Burke in 1860-61. Architecturally, the building is a dramatic contrast from the National Gallery and High Court. Built in the style of a Greek temple, its classical effect is underscored by the lavish use of marble and travertine on the columns and walls, and marble from Greece, Italy, and Australia used in the decoration of the interior. In the foyer are superb stained glass windows by Leonard French and three Aubusson tapestries woven from Australian wool. The lower floor displays treasures from the library's collection, and the Exhibitions Gallery hosts special visiting displays, which often require advance booking.","['//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9c/National_Library_of_Australia%2C_ACT_-_perspective_controlled.jpg/650px-National_Library_of_Australia%2C_ACT_-_perspective_controlled.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a3/National_Library_at_Dusk.jpg/670px-National_Library_at_Dusk.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9a/Autumn_on_Lake_Burley_Griffin.jpg/620px-Autumn_on_Lake_Burley_Griffin.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e9/East_face_of_the_Chifley_Library_August_2013.jpg']",https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d3256.376732315865!2d149.12763311497173!3d-35.2966195019947!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x6b164d17a74ac511%3A0x699681870a900677!2sNational%20Library%20of%20Australia!5e0!3m2!1sen!2sin!4v1601355753309!5m2!1sen!2sin,"['Hyatt Hotel Canberra - A Park Hyatt Hotel', 'Canberra City YHA', 'Novotel Canberra', 'Burbury Hotel Canberra', 'The Sebel Canberra Civic']",['National Library of Australia'],['Bookplate'],
Canberra,National Carillon,"
On Aspen Island in Lake Burley Griffin, the white Carillon Tower was a gift from the British government on Canberra's 50th birthday in 1963. The 50-meter-high tower incorporates three sleek columns clad in opal chip and quartz. Within the towers are 55 bronze bells ranging from seven kilograms to six metric tons. You can bring a picnic and relax on the surrounding lawns. Better still, visit during a recital (Wednesdays and Sundays from 12:30 to 1:20pm), when the music of the bells wafts across the lake. The tower looks especially beautiful when it's lit at night.","['//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f6/National_Carillon%2C_ACT_-_Rectilinear_projection.jpg/670px-National_Carillon%2C_ACT_-_Rectilinear_projection.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3d/National_Carillon_%28Canberra%29_-_bells.jpg/690px-National_Carillon_%28Canberra%29_-_bells.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/27/Balloon_and_National_Carillon_%28437591836%29.jpg/620px-Balloon_and_National_Carillon_%28437591836%29.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8d/Canberra_Lake_Burley_Griffin_Sunset-10_%285515585226%29.jpg/620px-Canberra_Lake_Burley_Griffin_Sunset-10_%285515585226%29.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/76/National_Carillon_Canberra_%283348278205%29.jpg/800px-National_Carillon_Canberra_%283348278205%29.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/66/Carillon_canberra.jpg']",https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m14!1m8!1m3!1d3256.3767323961238!2d149.1276331!3d-35.2966195!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x6b164d3d87d0bc11%3A0x628fffe6c7d56938!2sNational%20Carillon!5e0!3m2!1sen!2sin!4v1601357282637!5m2!1sen!2sin,"['Hyatt Hotel Canberra - A Park Hyatt Hotel', 'Hotel Kurrajong Canberra', 'Forrest Hotel and Apartments', 'Rydges Canberra', 'Crowne Plaza Canberra']",['National Carillon'],['National Carillon'],
Perth,Kings Park And Botanic Garden,"
With beautiful views of the Swan River and Darling Range, Kings Park and Botanic Garden is an oasis of peace near the heart of the city and one of the largest inner-city parks in the world. Almost two-thirds of this 1,000-acre park is natural bush, with a diversity of native plants and birds. Dedicated to conservation, the botanic garden spotlights plants from Western Australia and other Mediterranean climates such as South Africa and California. Highlights include an acacia garden, the peaceful Place of Reflection, and a water garden that recreates a Darling Range creek. Atop Mount Eliza, with stunning views over the city, the Kings Park War Memorial is a poignant tribute to servicemen from Western Australia. Walking trails weave through the park, and you can even wander through the treetops at the Lotterywest Federation Walkway, suspended in a canopy of eucalyptus trees. Other park features include ponds, play areas, and panoramic viewpoints. After a stroll through the park, pop into Aspect of Kings Park, a retail precinct of gift shops and galleries highlighting local artists. Fraser Avenue Lookout dishes up delicious views of the city, and, at night, the park is the perfect spot for a romantic stroll with twinkling views of the city lights.","['//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1e/Kings_Park_War_Memorial_Sunrise.jpg/640px-Kings_Park_War_Memorial_Sunrise.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/eb/Kings_Park_from_QV.1.jpg/620px-Kings_Park_from_QV.1.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8b/Kings_Park_from_South_Perth.jpg/620px-Kings_Park_from_South_Perth.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/51/Perth_CBD_-_Kings_Park.jpg/800px-Perth_CBD_-_Kings_Park.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c3/KingsPark-Panorama2.jpg/800px-KingsPark-Panorama2.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/23/KingsPark-Panorama1.jpg/800px-KingsPark-Panorama1.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e9/Dawn_service_gnangarra_03.jpg/620px-Dawn_service_gnangarra_03.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/65/Fraser_Avenue_precinct_by_D.Blumer.jpg/620px-Fraser_Avenue_precinct_by_D.Blumer.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e8/Kings_Park_WA_aug_2012_gnangarra-17.jpg/620px-Kings_Park_WA_aug_2012_gnangarra-17.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/04/Synergy_Parkland_by_M.Griffiths.jpg/620px-Synergy_Parkland_by_M.Griffiths.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c6/Kings_park_gnangarra_250815-102.jpg/670px-Kings_park_gnangarra_250815-102.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/94/Lotterywest_Federation_Walkway_by_T.Scalzo.jpg/620px-Lotterywest_Federation_Walkway_by_T.Scalzo.jpg']",https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d3384.999656273008!2d115.83000421485933!3d-31.960906029997698!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x2a32a525098d1f2f%3A0xec4a7b90626730e7!2sKings%20Park%20and%20Botanic%20Garden!5e0!3m2!1sen!2sin!4v1601372428022!5m2!1sen!2sin,"['Kings Park Motel', 'Quest Kings Park', 'Tribe Perth Kings Park', 'Quest Mounts Bay Road', 'Nesuto Mounts Bay Apartment Hotel (Formerly Mounts Bay Waters Apartment Hotel)']","['Kings Park and Botanic Garden', ""Giant Boab 'Gija Jumulu'"", 'Botanic Gardens and Parks Authority', 'Rio Tinto Naturescape Kings Park', ""Pioneer Women's Memorial""]","[""Fraser's Restaurant"", 'Botanical Cafe', 'Kings Park Kiosk', 'Zamia Cafe', ""Fraser's Events & Catering""]",

Sydney,Sydney Harbour Bridge,"
The Sydney Harbour Bridge or Coathanger, as locals call it, was the city's best-known landmark prior to construction of the Sydney Opera House. Supported by massive double piers at each end, it was built in 1932 and remains the world's largest steel arch bridge, connecting the harbor's north and south shores in a single curve rising 134 meters above the water. Along its length run two railway lines and eight lanes for road traffic, the direction of which can be varied according to traffic flow. Increasing bridge traffic encouraged construction of a harbor tunnel in 1992 to ease congestion, but motorists can still drive over the bridge for blue-water views. Pedestrians can stroll across on walkways or join a guided ascent through BridgeClimb for a breathtaking panorama of the city and harbor. To learn about the fascinating history of the bridge's construction, visit the museum in the southeastern pier. Daring souls who want to climb to the 135-meter-high summit can book the Sydney BridgeClimb. This is a spectacular opportunity that takes groups of up to 13 people on an approximately 3.5-hour climb to the top of the outer arch.","['//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a8/Sydney_harbour_bridge_new_south_wales.jpg/690px-Sydney_harbour_bridge_new_south_wales.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c3/A_close_view_of_Sydney_Harbour_Bridge_at_night.jpg/620px-A_close_view_of_Sydney_Harbour_Bridge_at_night.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0a/Sydney_Harbour_Bridge_cyclist.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/ff/SydneyHarbourBridgeHangers.jpg/625px-SydneyHarbourBridgeHangers.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/09/BridgeClimb_participants_on_Sydney_Harbour_Bridge.jpg/620px-BridgeClimb_participants_on_Sydney_Harbour_Bridge.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/79/BridgeClimb_on_Sydney_Harbour_Bridge%2C_jjron%2C_02.12.2010.jpg/620px-BridgeClimb_on_Sydney_Harbour_Bridge%2C_jjron%2C_02.12.2010.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/de/SHB75.jpg/670px-SHB75.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ea/Sydney_Harbour_Bridge_night.jpg/1000px-Sydney_Harbour_Bridge_night.jpg']",https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d3313.350061361516!2d151.20709221492214!3d-33.854868175766626!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x6b12ae5d25ead5e3%3A0x68948eb717c0c43e!2sSydney%20Harbour%20Bridge!5e0!3m2!1sen!2sin!4v1601379457667!5m2!1sen!2sin,"['Pier One Sydney Harbour, Autograph Collection', 'Park Hyatt Sydney', 'Rydges Sydney Harbour', 'Shangri-La Hotel, Sydney', 'Sydney Harbour YHA - The Rocks']","['BridgeClimb Sydney', 'Pylon Lookout']","['Ripples Milsons Point', 'Sydney Harbour Bridge', 'The Dining Room', 'Mercantile Hotel', 'Aqua Dining']",
Sydney,The Rocks,"
On a tongue of land protruding into Sydney Harbour, the Rocks historic area was once home to the Gadigal aboriginal people and later became the country's first site of European settlement. The name of the Rocks comes from the rocky coast on the west side of Sydney Cove, where the convicts pitched their tents. Today, more than 100 heritage sites and buildings jostle along the narrow streets, including Sydney's oldest surviving house, Cadman's cottage, built in 1816. First stop should be a visit to the Rocks Discovery Museum, which traces the area's fascinating transformation from traditional aboriginal lands to convict slum to tourist hot spot. Afterwards, wander around the narrow cobbled streets with their souvenir shops, restaurants, cafés, and aboriginal and contemporary art galleries, or shop at the market stalls.","['//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/be/Street_through_The_Rocks.jpg/670px-Street_through_The_Rocks.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/14/Sydney_The_Rocks.jpg/620px-Sydney_The_Rocks.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c1/Former_English%2C_Scottish_%26_Australian_Chartered_Bank_-_The_Rocks%2C_Sydney%2C_NSW_%287889979044%29.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b6/SydneyTheRocks1_gobeirne.jpg/670px-SydneyTheRocks1_gobeirne.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/Bannersydneyrocks.jpg']",https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d6626.399099642719!2d151.20363592480118!3d-33.85874781324338!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x6b12ae42b65d8fb3%3A0x5017d681632cd60!2sThe%20Rocks%20NSW%202000%2C%20Australia!5e0!3m2!1sen!2sin!4v1601388383294!5m2!1sen!2sin,"['Rydges Sydney Harbour', 'Rendezvous Hotel Sydney The Rocks', 'Shangri-La Hotel, Sydney', 'Sydney Harbour YHA - The Rocks', 'Harbour Rocks Hotel Sydney - MGallery by Sofitel']","['The Rocks Walking Tours', 'The Rocks Discovery Museum', 'Cadmans Cottage', 'Susannah Place', 'Hickson Road Reserve']","['Pancakes On The Rocks', 'Sak� Restaurant', 'Quay Restaurant', 'Harts Pub', 'William Blue Dining']",
Sydney,Darling Harbour,"
A hub for tourists and locals alike, Darling Harbour is a waterfront pedestrian precinct packed with shops, restaurants, museums, exhibitions, and entertainment venues. Families will love Madame Tussaud's; the WILD LIFE Sydney Zoo; and the SEA LIFE Sydney Aquarium, which contains the world's largest collection of Australian marine creatures. The SEA LIFE Sydney Aquarium Entrance Ticket is a great way to get ahead of the crowds and it also offers discounts on other attractions. Powerhouse Museum offers interactive exhibits on science, technology, design, and history, while nautical-minded history buffs can board a replica of Captain Cook's ship, Endeavour, at the Australian National Maritime Museum. Younger children will love the carousel, playground, and water park. An IMAX and 9D theater, harbor jet boat rides, simulated flights and racing car adventures round out the exciting attractions. Those seeking a tranquil patch of green amid all the excitement can slip into the Chinese Garden of Friendship and sip tea among the willows and koi ponds.","['//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9b/Darling_harbour_twilight_photo.jpg/600px-Darling_harbour_twilight_photo.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/80/Darling_Harbour_at_dusk.jpg/600px-Darling_Harbour_at_dusk.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a9/Darling_harbour_from_national_maratime_museum.jpg/620px-Darling_harbour_from_national_maratime_museum.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/12/Harbourside%2C_Darling_Harbour_at_Night_2019.jpg/620px-Harbourside%2C_Darling_Harbour_at_Night_2019.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/44/Sydney_sunset_darling_harbour.jpg/620px-Sydney_sunset_darling_harbour.jpg']",https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d3312.573708176744!2d151.1987113149227!3d-33.874875526805035!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x6b12ae47076bdbb7%3A0x738f78eda4ded6f0!2sDarling%20Harbour!5e0!3m2!1sen!2sin!4v1601388882906!5m2!1sen!2sin,"['ibis Sydney Darling Harbour', 'Sydney Darling Harbour Hotel', 'Meriton Suites Kent Street, Sydney', 'Sofitel Sydney Darling Harbour', 'Crowne Plaza Sydney Darling Harbour']","['Darling Quarter', 'SEA LIFE Sydney Aquarium', 'Tumbalong Park', 'Australian National Maritime Museum', 'Sydney Harbour Bridge']","['Darling Harbour', 'Nok Nok Thai Eating House', 'RASHAYS - Darling Harbour', 'Braza Churrascaria', 'Mediterranea Restaurant']",
Sydney,Royal Botanic Garden,"
A tranquil oasis amid the hustle and bustle of the city, the Royal Botanic Garden at Farm Cove lies a short and scenic stroll along the waterfront from the Sydney Opera House. The gardens were established in 1816 and encompass 30 hectares of themed gardens with towering trees, palm groves, orchids, ferns, and flocks of fruit bats. Visiting the gardens is one of the many wonderful things to do in Sydney for free. Among the highlights are the Palace Rose Garden, which includes some 1,800 roses, and the Glasshouse Latitude 23 and Fernery, brimming with tropical foliage, begonias, and orchids. For the less energetic, a hop-on, hop-off train tours the grounds. After exploring the gardens, you can relax at the café or restaurants, or enjoy a hillside picnic with beautiful harbor views. Surrounding the gardens is the Domain, a popular event venue, with open green space and sports areas, and while you're visiting the gardens, you can enjoy views of Government House, the official residence of the governor of New South Wales.","['//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2a/Gates_at_Royal_Botanic_Gardens_viewed_from_Art_Gallery_Road.jpg/600px-Gates_at_Royal_Botanic_Gardens_viewed_from_Art_Gallery_Road.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/80/Sydney_Opera_house_3.jpg/670px-Sydney_Opera_house_3.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3d/The_Mare_%26_Foal_Lawn_view_2017.jpg/670px-The_Mare_%26_Foal_Lawn_view_2017.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/43/Sydney_from_domain.jpg/691px-Sydney_from_domain.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/52/Rbg_9550.jpg/670px-Rbg_9550.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f1/Royal_Botanic_Gardens_Flower_Bed_Lawn_2017.jpg/670px-Royal_Botanic_Gardens_Flower_Bed_Lawn_2017.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/30/Royal_Botanic_Gardens_Main_Pond_2017.jpg/670px-Royal_Botanic_Gardens_Main_Pond_2017.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/72/Royal_Botanic_Gardens_Sydney_Lotus_Pond_in_Winter_201708.jpg/670px-Royal_Botanic_Gardens_Sydney_Lotus_Pond_in_Winter_201708.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e1/Royal_Botanic_Gardens_Sydney_Main_Pond_201708.jpg/670px-Royal_Botanic_Gardens_Sydney_Main_Pond_201708.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/da/Boy_Extracting_Thorn_Statue_2017.jpg/670px-Boy_Extracting_Thorn_Statue_2017.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/67/Writings_in_bamboo_plant_at_Royal_Botanic_Garden%2C_Circular_Quay%2C_Sydney.jpg/672px-Writings_in_bamboo_plant_at_Royal_Botanic_Garden%2C_Circular_Quay%2C_Sydney.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/54/Royal_Botanic_Gardens_Fountain_201708.jpg/670px-Royal_Botanic_Gardens_Fountain_201708.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e3/Royal_Botanic_Gardens_Sydney_Succulent_Garden_2017.jpg/670px-Royal_Botanic_Gardens_Sydney_Succulent_Garden_2017.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f5/Royal_Botanic_Gardens_View3_201708.jpg/670px-Royal_Botanic_Gardens_View3_201708.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/09/Sandstone_Pavillion_-_Herb_Garden_201708.jpg/670px-Sandstone_Pavillion_-_Herb_Garden_201708.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/11/Roses_in_the_Botanical_Gardens_%286603451215%29.jpg/620px-Roses_in_the_Botanical_Gardens_%286603451215%29.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/74/Royal_Botanic_Gardens_Sydney_Cupid_Statue_201708.jpg/670px-Royal_Botanic_Gardens_Sydney_Cupid_Statue_201708.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/70/Royal_Botanic_Gardens_Sydney_Morshead_Fountain_2017.jpg/670px-Royal_Botanic_Gardens_Sydney_Morshead_Fountain_2017.jpg']",https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d3312.9887258618787!2d151.2143821149224!3d-33.8641814262499!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x6b12ae6b60dda459%3A0xf017d68f9f1e7a0!2sRoyal%20Botanic%20Garden%20Sydney!5e0!3m2!1sen!2sin!4v1601389674528!5m2!1sen!2sin,"['Pullman Quay Grand Sydney Harbour', 'The Grand Hotel', 'Rydges Sydney Harbour', 'InterContinental Sydney', 'Shangri-La Hotel, Sydney']","['The Sydney Fernery', 'The Calyx', 'Sydney Opera House', 'Palace Rose Garden & Pavilion', 'Palm House']","['Botanic House', 'Sydney Cove Oyster Bar', 'Terrace on the Domain', 'The Spice Room', 'Cafe Sydney']",
Sydney,Queen Victoria Building,"
A high point of Sydney shopping is the Romanesque-style Queen Victoria Building (QVB), linked by underground arcades with Town Hall Station. Originally built as a market hall between 1893 and 1898, this elegant building is crowned by a high central dome surrounded by 20 smaller domes. After decades of neglect and even plans for demolition, this grand sandstone building was restored to its original state in the early 1980s. Today, more than 200 high-end shops line its light-filled galleries. It's worth a visit, even for those who shun the shops, just to admire its successful restoration, as well as its beautiful stained glass windows and mosaic floors. The Tea Room QVB hosts a High Tea under crystal chandeliers here that is popular with locals and visitors.","['//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/54/%281%29QVB-9.jpg/670px-%281%29QVB-9.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/97/QBV_from_above.jpg/670px-QBV_from_above.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b1/Queen_Victoria_Building_Stain-Glass_Dome_from_Below.jpg/620px-Queen_Victoria_Building_Stain-Glass_Dome_from_Below.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/55/Queen_Victoria_Building_Stain-Glass_Dome_from_Above.jpg/620px-Queen_Victoria_Building_Stain-Glass_Dome_from_Above.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/94/Great_Australian_Clock.jpg/600px-Great_Australian_Clock.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9c/Interior_of_the_Queen_Victoria_Building%2C_Sydney.jpg/613px-Interior_of_the_Queen_Victoria_Building%2C_Sydney.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d1/QVBclock137lg.jpg/610px-QVBclock137lg.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c0/Queen-Victoria-Statue-Outside-QV-Building.jpg/620px-Queen-Victoria-Statue-Outside-QV-Building.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c4/Qvbsyd.jpg/620px-Qvbsyd.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ed/QVB_night.jpg/620px-QVB_night.jpg']",https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d3312.6962761595582!2d151.2045191149227!3d-33.87171752664101!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x6b12ae3c36fc2c21%3A0xbf6ac40e233d3415!2sQueen%20Victoria%20Building!5e0!3m2!1sen!2sin!4v1601390254428!5m2!1sen!2sin,"['Park Regis City Centre', 'Sydney Hotel QVB', 'Megaboom City Hotel', 'Castlereagh Boutique Hotel', 'Meriton Suites Kent Street, Sydney']",['Queen Victoria Building'],"['Cellinis Restaurant and Bar', 'Kikko Cafe', 'The Palace Tea Room', 'Parisi QVB', 'Vanto Italian Restaurant']",
Sydney,The Sydney Tower Eye,"
Soaring above the city skyline, the 309-meter-high Sydney Tower Eye is the city's tallest building and one of its great landmarks (other than the Opera House and Harbour Bridge, of course). This golden spire-topped turret rises from the busy Centrepoint shopping mall. Express lifts whisk visitors to the observation deck at the top, or to SKYWALK, an alfresco glass-floor viewing platform, the perfect spot for sightseeing. While up there, you can enjoy panoramic views of Sydney and its surrounding suburbs or enjoy a bite to eat at one of the revolving restaurants or the café. Also on offer is a 4D cinema experience, which provides an overview of the city's major icons.","['//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/02/Centre_Point_Tower_In_Sydney_Edit.jpg/600px-Centre_Point_Tower_In_Sydney_Edit.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9b/The_Westfield_Centrepoint_Tower_%286619289471%29.jpg/680px-The_Westfield_Centrepoint_Tower_%286619289471%29.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2f/Centrepoint_looking_up.jpg/669px-Centrepoint_looking_up.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/42/Sydney_tower_sunset.jpg/618px-Sydney_tower_sunset.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/30/%281%29Market_Street_Sydney.jpg/668px-%281%29Market_Street_Sydney.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a1/Sydney_Tower_view_from_Pitt_St_mall_-_panoramio.jpg/650px-Sydney_Tower_view_from_Pitt_St_mall_-_panoramio.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8a/Sydney_Tower_Revolving_Restauarant.jpg/629px-Sydney_Tower_Revolving_Restauarant.jpg']",https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d3312.745603245269!2d151.20657131492257!3d-33.870446526575144!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x6b12ae3fb870a0cb%3A0xe21b547d906c24ca!2sSydney%20Tower%20Eye!5e0!3m2!1sen!2sin!4v1601390554587!5m2!1sen!2sin,"['Hotel Swiss�tel Sydney', 'Meriton Suites Kent Street, Sydney', 'Hilton Sydney', 'Sheraton Grand Sydney Hyde Park', 'QT Sydney']",['Sydney Tower Eye'],"['Sydney Tower Eye', 'Infinity']",
