England,Stonehenge,"
Stonehenge, 10 miles north of the historic city of Salisbury on Salisbury Plain, is Europe's best-known prehistoric monument. It's so popular that visitors need to purchase a timed ticket in advance to guarantee entry. Exhibitions at the excellent Stonehenge visitor center set the stage for a visit, explaining through audio-visual experiences and more than 250 ancient objects how the megaliths were erected between 3000 and 1500 BC, and sharing information about life during this time. After walking around the various viewing points adjacent to these enormous stones, visit the authentic replicas of Neolithic Houses to see the tools and implements of everyday Neolithic life as volunteers demonstrate skills from 4,500 years ago. Although you can't go inside the circle to wander among the stones during normal opening hours, you can reserve special early morning or late evening access into the circle through English Heritage, which manages the site.","['//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3c/Stonehenge2007_07_30.jpg/720px-Stonehenge2007_07_30.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b7/Stonehenge_dagger.jpg/620px-Stonehenge_dagger.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fe/Stonehenge_Heel_Stone_-_panoramio_%282%29.jpg/670px-Stonehenge_Heel_Stone_-_panoramio_%282%29.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/52/Summer_Solstice_Sunrise_over_Stonehenge_2005.jpg/620px-Summer_Solstice_Sunrise_over_Stonehenge_2005.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Stonehenge_cloudy_sunset.jpg/620px-Stonehenge_cloudy_sunset.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/63/Stonehenge_Closeup.jpg/620px-Stonehenge_Closeup.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a6/Stonehenge-Green.jpg/700px-Stonehenge-Green.jpg','//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/35/Stonehenge_on_27.01.08.jpg/620px-Stonehenge_on_27.01.08.jpg']"
England,Tower of London,"
Prison, palace, treasure vault, observatory, and menagerie: the Tower of London has done it all and it's one of the top attractions in London. Widely considered the most important building in England, there's enough to see and do at this World Heritage Site to keep visitors busy for hours. The centerpiece of this Thames-side fortress is the White Tower. Built in 1078 by William the Conqueror, it's home to amazing exhibits, such as Line of Kings, the world's oldest visitor attraction, established in 1652 with a remarkable display of royal armor. Other highlights include the impressive Crown Jewels exhibition, classic Yeoman Warder Tours, the Royal Mint, and exhibits and displays regarding prisoners and executions. All told, the Tower of London covers some 18 acres, so there's a great deal of exploring to do.","['//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ec/Tower_of_London_from_the_Shard_%288515883950%29.jpg/620px-Tower_of_London_from_the_Shard_%288515883950%29.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1e/Whitetowerlondon.jpg/670px-Whitetowerlondon.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b2/St_John%27s_Chapel%2C_Tower_of_London.jpg/620px-St_John%27s_Chapel%2C_Tower_of_London.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/04/Panoramic_view_from_Tower_of_London_cropped.jpg/800px-Panoramic_view_from_Tower_of_London_cropped.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1e/London_Tower_%28CherryX%29.jpg/600px-London_Tower_%28CherryX%29.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/18/Panorama_of_the_outer_curtain_wall_of_the_Tower_of_London%2C_2006.jpg/800px-Panorama_of_the_outer_curtain_wall_of_the_Tower_of_London%2C_2006.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f0/Tower_of_London_White_Tower.jpg/600px-Tower_of_London_White_Tower.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/06/Tower_of_London_%28Foto_Hilarmont%29.jpg/600px-Tower_of_London_%28Foto_Hilarmont%29.jpg']"
England,The Roman Baths,"
If you only have time to visit one smaller city in England, you couldn't do much better than Bath. This remarkably beautiful city in Somerset boasts more fantastic tourist attractions than you could hope to visit in a day. While most famous for the magnificent 2,000-year-old Roman Baths built around the city's rejuvenating hot springs, it's equally well known for its honey-colored Georgian Townhouses, such as those located on Royal Crescent. Some 500 of the city's buildings are considered of historical or architectural importance, a fact that has resulted in the entire city being granted World Heritage status. Bath makes an ideal location from which to explore some of England's most stunning countryside, including the Avon Valley, the Mendip Hills, and countless other fantastic Somerset landmarks.","['//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/08/Roman_Baths_in_Bath_Spa%2C_England_-_July_2006.jpg/640px-Roman_Baths_in_Bath_Spa%2C_England_-_July_2006.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e9/Bladud_Statue_at_Roman_Baths%2C_Bath.jpg/670px-Bladud_Statue_at_Roman_Baths%2C_Bath.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2e/Bath_abbey_and_roman_baths_arp.jpg/653px-Bath_abbey_and_roman_baths_arp.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/07/Roman_Baths%2C_Bath_-_Main_bath.jpg/631px-Roman_Baths%2C_Bath_-_Main_bath.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/27/Roman_Baths%2C_Bath_-_Sacred_Spring.jpg/620px-Roman_Baths%2C_Bath_-_Sacred_Spring.jpg','//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b5/Roman_baths_2014_01.jpg']"

Covering some 900 square miles, Lake District National Park is a must-visit destination for travelers to England. With 12 of the country's largest lakes and more than 2,000 miles of rights of way waiting to be explored, there's little wonder the region continues to inspire, with its magnificent views and scenery straight out of a painting. Other things to do include visiting the park's many fells, including Scafell Pike (3,210 feet), the highest mountain in England.

England,Canterbury Cathedral,"
Located in the heart of the historic city that bears its name, Canterbury Cathedral (a UNESCO World Heritage Site) is home to the Archbishop of Canterbury and is the cradle of English Christianity. It all started when St. Augustine converted the pagan Anglo Saxons here in 597 when he became the first bishop. But there's much more to this beautiful medieval city than just its cathedral. Canterbury is also a popular cultural and entertainment destination with great shopping, galleries, and caf√©s, as well as attractions such as those focused on Chaucer's medieval England and the city's Roman past. Some of the other best places to visit in Canterbury include the Old City, the ruins of St. Augustine's Abbey, and medieval Beaney House.","['//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1f/Canterbury-cathedral-wyrdlight.jpg/620px-Canterbury-cathedral-wyrdlight.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/da/Canterburycathedralthrone.jpg/670px-Canterburycathedralthrone.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7e/Canterbury_Cathedral_Choir_2%2C_Kent%2C_UK_-_Diliff.jpg/620px-Canterbury_Cathedral_Choir_2%2C_Kent%2C_UK_-_Diliff.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/73/TOMB_OF_THE_BLACK_PRINCE%2C_CANTERBURY_CATHEDRAL.jpg/620px-TOMB_OF_THE_BLACK_PRINCE%2C_CANTERBURY_CATHEDRAL.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/39/Canterbury_Cathedral_Trinity_Chapel_Stained_Glass%2C_Kent%2C_UK_-_Diliff.jpg/670px-Canterbury_Cathedral_Trinity_Chapel_Stained_Glass%2C_Kent%2C_UK_-_Diliff.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fd/Canterbury_Cathedral_Becket%27s_Crown%2C_Kent%2C_UK_-_Diliff.jpg/670px-Canterbury_Cathedral_Becket%27s_Crown%2C_Kent%2C_UK_-_Diliff.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f3/Canterbury_Cathedral_Cloisters%2C_Kent%2C_UK_-_Diliff.jpg/620px-Canterbury_Cathedral_Cloisters%2C_Kent%2C_UK_-_Diliff.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/36/CANTERBURY_CATHEDRAL_GLASS_C7471.jpg/620px-CANTERBURY_CATHEDRAL_GLASS_C7471.jpg']"
England,Eden Project,"
The incredible Eden Project is a collection of unique artificial biomes containing an amazing collection of plants from around the world. Located in a reclaimed quarry in Cornwall, this spectacular botanical gardens complex consists of huge domes that look rather like massive igloo-shaped greenhouses. Each of these impressive (and futuristic-looking) buildings houses thousands of different plant species in tropical and Mediterranean environments. As well as these stunning displays of plant life, the Eden Project hosts numerous arts and music events year-round. If you're able to extend your visit, consider booking a stay at the on-site hostel, or enjoy a meal in one of its restaurants.

England,The Cotswolds,"
The Cotswolds cover some 787 square miles and encompass parts of some of England's prettiest counties: Gloucestershire, Oxfordshire, Wiltshire, Somerset, Worcestershire, and Warwickshire. And all of it begs to be explored. Designated an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty due to its rare limestone grassland habitats and old-growth beech woodlands, the beauty of the Cotswolds has much to do with its quaint villages and towns, such as Castle Combe, Chipping Norton, and Tetbury. Like so much of England, the Cotswolds is perfect to discover on foot. One of the best routes is along the Cotswold Way, a 102-mile footpath with spectacular views of the Severn Valley and the Vale of Evesham. This route runs the length of the Cotswolds, and can be picked up pretty much anywhere you visit.","['//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e7/Castle_combe_cotswolds.jpg/684px-Castle_combe_cotswolds.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/24/Bibury_Cottages_in_the_Cotswolds_-_June_2007.jpg/620px-Bibury_Cottages_in_the_Cotswolds_-_June_2007.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a9/Broadway_row_b_8294.jpg/620px-Broadway_row_b_8294.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/22/Broadway_row_houses_b_8302.jpg/620px-Broadway_row_houses_b_8302.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f1/Thatch_and_slate_roof%2C_Stretton-on-Fosse%2C_Cotswolds_165445.jpg/620px-Thatch_and_slate_roof%2C_Stretton-on-Fosse%2C_Cotswolds_165445.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bd/Cotswolds_Panorama_Fields.jpg/880px-Cotswolds_Panorama_Fields.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bc/Sudeley_Castle_Secret_Garden.jpg/670px-Sudeley_Castle_Secret_Garden.jpg']"
France,Eiffel Tower,"
The symbol of Paris, the Eiffel Tower is a feat of ingenuity as much as it is a famous landmark. This structure of 8,000 metallic parts was designed by Gustave Eiffel as a temporary exhibit for the World Fair of 1889. Originally loathed by critics, the 320-meter-high tower is now a beloved and irreplaceable fixture of the Paris skyline. The Eiffel Tower's gracefulness has earned it the nickname of Iron Lady. Visitors are impressed by the tower's delicate airiness despite its monumental size and the breathtaking panoramas at each of the three levels. Tourists can dine with a view at the first level or indulge at the Michelin-starred Le Jules Verne restaurant on the second level. At the exhilarating height of 276 meters, the top level offers a sweeping outlook over the city of Paris and beyond. Vistas extend as far as 70 kilometers on a clear day.","['//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/85/Tour_Eiffel_Wikimedia_Commons_%28cropped%29.jpg/640px-Tour_Eiffel_Wikimedia_Commons_%28cropped%29.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0d/Eiffel_Tower_Uploaded_by_Argonowski.jpg/600px-Eiffel_Tower_Uploaded_by_Argonowski.jpg','//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/79/Tour_Eiffel_09.jpg','//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/44/Eiffel_Tower_and_Front_de_Seine_quarter_from_Pont_Mirabeau%2C_12_April_2014.jpg','//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d4/Ajfelov_toranj_noƒáu.jpg','//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d8/Eiffel_Tower%2C_November_15%2C_2011.jpg']"
France,Louvre Museum,"
In a stately palace that was once a royal residence, the Louvre ranks among the top European collections of fine arts. Many of Western Civilization's most famous works are found here, including the Mona Lisa by Leonardo DaVinci, the Wedding Feast at Cana by Veronese, and the 1st-century-BC Venus de Milo sculpture. The collection owes its wealth to the contributions of various kings who lived in the Louvre. Other pieces were added as a result of France's treaties with the Vatican and the Republic of Venice, and from the spoils of Napol√©on I. The Louvre has an astounding collection of 35,000 artworks, including countless masterpieces.","['//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/66/Louvre_Museum_Wikimedia_Commons.jpg/720px-Louvre_Museum_Wikimedia_Commons.jpg','//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cd/Donjon_chateau_louvre.JPG','//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/19/Louvre_Grab.JPG', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a2/Louvre_Courtyard%2C_Looking_West.jpg/805px-Louvre_Courtyard%2C_Looking_West.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e4/Paris_July_2011-27a.jpg/812px-Paris_July_2011-27a.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/42/Louvre_Pyramid.jpg/720px-Louvre_Pyramid.jpg']"
France,Palace of Versailles,"
More than just a royal residence, Versailles was designed to show off the glory of the French monarchy. Sun King Louis XIV transformed his father's small hunting lodge into an opulent palace with a sumptuous Baroque interior. The palace became Louis XIV\'s symbol of absolute power and set the standard for princely courts in Europe. Architect Jules Hardouin-Mansart created the elegant Baroque facade and lavish interior of the Ch√¢teau de Versailles, which is designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The most emblematic space in the castle is the Hall of Mirrors, where courtiers waited for an audience with His Majesty. This dazzling hall sparkles with sunlight that enters through the windows and is reflected off massive ornamental mirrors. Versailles is equally renowned for Les Jardins, formal French gardens featuring decorative pools, perfectly trimmed shrubbery, and magnificent fountains. The gardens were created in the 17th century by renowned landscape designer Andr√© Le N√¥tre and are surrounded by 800 hectares of lush parkland. Beyond the formal gardens is the Domaine de Trianon, which includes Le Grand Trianon palace; Le Petit Trianon ch√¢teau; and Le Hameau de la Reine, Marie-Antoinette's fabricated pastoral village featuring quaint rustic buildings set around a lake. Marie-Antoinette's hamlet originally had a working dairy and farm. This idyllic spot was designed as a place for Marie-Antoinette to escape court life and spend time with her children. Marie-Antoinette also came here for walks and to visit with friends. The hamlet is one of the best places to visit at the Ch√¢teau de Versailles to get a glimpse of the private world of Marie-Antoinette.","['//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9a/Versailles-Chateau-Jardins02_%28cropped%29.jpg/600px-Versailles-Chateau-Jardins02_%28cropped%29.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f1/Chateau_Versailles_Galerie_des_Glaces.jpg/600px-Chateau_Versailles_Galerie_des_Glaces.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/be/Gardens_of_Versailles_%E5%87%A1%E7%88%BE%E8%B3%BD%E8%8A%B1%E5%9C%92_-_panoramio.jpg/600px-Gardens_of_Versailles_%E5%87%A1%E7%88%BE%E8%B3%BD%E8%8A%B1%E5%9C%92_-_panoramio.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e8/Cour_de_Marbre_du_Ch%C3%A2teau_de_Versailles_October_5%2C_2011.jpg/652px-Cour_de_Marbre_du_Ch%C3%A2teau_de_Versailles_October_5%2C_2011.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/96/Vue_a%C3%A9rienne_du_domaine_de_Versailles_par_ToucanWings_001.jpg/620px-Vue_a%C3%A9rienne_du_domaine_de_Versailles_par_ToucanWings_001.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b5/Palace_of_Versailles_%285987331118%29.jpg/673px-Palace_of_Versailles_%285987331118%29.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a3/Versaillespanoraama2.jpg/1088px-Versaillespanoraama2.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/be/Peter_Stehlik_2013.04.22_Panorama_1A.jpg/1384px-Peter_Stehlik_2013.04.22_Panorama_1A.jpg','//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a5/Grand_Trianon_P√©ristyle.JPG']"

Some of the prettiest villages in France are tucked away in the green, rolling hills of Alsace, where the Vosges Mountains border the Rhine River of Germany. These picturesque Alsatian villages feature pastel-painted, half-timbered houses clustered around small parish churches. Cheerful flowering balconies and pedestrian cobblestone streets add to the appeal. Many of the villages have won France's Villages Fleuris award for their lovely floral decorations, such as Obernai, with its characteristic burghers' houses; the charming little village of Ribeauvill√©, where many homes are adorned with potted flowers; the town of art and history Guebwiller; and the captivating medieval village of Bergheim.

Another Most Beautiful Village is Mittelbergheim, known for its gastronomy and gorgeous pastoral landscape, at the foot of the verdant Mont Saint-Odile. For those planning an Alsace vacation itinerary, Colmar is a good base to explore the Alsatian villages and surrounding nature trails.","['//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/85/View_of_%C3%89glise_Saint-Martin_%2843833049001%29.jpg/648px-View_of_%C3%89glise_Saint-Martin_%2843833049001%29.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/1138357639_3c5c483074_o_Haut_Koenigsbourg_CC_by_Fr_Antunes.jpg/698px-1138357639_3c5c483074_o_Haut_Koenigsbourg_CC_by_Fr_Antunes.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/46/Riquewihr_Dolder.jpg/698px-Riquewihr_Dolder.jpg','//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5e/Barr_Place_de_l%27H√¥tel_de_ville.JPG','//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/90/Barr_%28Bas-Rhin%29_Rue_typique.JPG']"
Finland,Suomenlinna Fortress,"
One of the world's largest sea fortresses, the 18th-century fort on Suomenlinna is a 15-minute ferry ride from Helsinki's Market Square (a mini-cruise that has lovely views of the city as a bonus attraction). Once here, you could easily fill a day with its sights and activities. The impressive fortifications, now a UNESCO World Heritage Site, were built in 1847 by the Swedes (Finland was Swedish territory then) to scare off the Russians; they weren't scared and later captured both the fort and Finland. Begin with the audio-visual experience in the visitor center (it's in English) for a lively history, then explore its ramparts, tunnels, and museums and walk the trails around the beautiful island. Or sign up here for a guided walk to learn more about the fort and its various attractions. Among these are the 250-ton Vesikko submarine, used by the Finnish Navy from 1936 until the end of World War II. The Ehrensv√§rd Museum illustrates the earliest Swedish period, and the Doll and Toy Museum displays dolls, dollhouses, and toys in an old Russian villa. Various buildings house studios and shops of glassblowers, potters, and other craftsmen, and in the summer, you can stay for evening dance and musical performances of the Suomenlinna Summer Theatre.","['//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/da/Suomenlinna.jpg/640px-Suomenlinna.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/68/Suomenlinna_merelt%C3%A4_5.jpg/660px-Suomenlinna_merelt%C3%A4_5.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/27/Guns_of_Suomenlinna.jpg/620px-Guns_of_Suomenlinna.jpg','//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/af/Suomenlinna_aerial.JPG']"
Finland,Rovaniemi,"
The Arctic Circle runs across northern Finland, right through the town of Rovaniemi, giving it claim to being the Gateway to the Arctic. In the summer, this means the famous Midnight Sun. While the sun only stays above the horizon for a full 24 hours in Rovaniemi on the summer solstice in late June, from late May to early August it never drops far enough for it to get dark. Locals are out enjoying their great outdoors throughout these White Nights and welcome tourists to join them. Rovaniemi is in the center of a vast natural area of rushing rivers for canoeing, swimming, or fishing, with trails alongside them for hiking and cycling. The city is best known (ask any Finnish child) as the home of Santa Claus, right astride the Arctic Circle at Santa Claus Village. You can meet reindeer here or visit a Sami reindeer farm. To learn more about the Lapland culture and about the natural history, meteorology and geology of the Arctic, visit the stunning Arktikum Science Museum. In the winter, this region is a paradise for skiers and others who love snow and ice sports. You can ride across frozen lakes and visit Sami villages on a dogsled safari, learn to drive your own reindeer sled, snowshoe or cross-country ski for miles, and watch the spectacular Northern Lights. Downhill skiers head about 170 kilometers north to Levi, a center for all winter recreation, with miles of scenic Nordic ski trails, lighted for night skiing. So are the pistes and slopes of Finland's largest downhill ski area. Many hotels have rooms with glass ceilings, so you can watch the Northern Lights from inside.","['//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2b/Rovaniemi_Montage.jpg/650px-Rovaniemi_Montage.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f0/Rovaniemi_06101999_rescanned.jpg/600px-Rovaniemi_06101999_rescanned.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b4/Tk3_1147_in_Rovaniemi_20120210_01.jpg/660px-Tk3_1147_in_Rovaniemi_20120210_01.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0d/Rovaniemi1.jpg/660px-Rovaniemi1.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c1/Santa_Claus_Village_20170201.jpg/660px-Santa_Claus_Village_20170201.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1b/Rovaniemi_-_Aurora_Borealis.jpg/670px-Rovaniemi_-_Aurora_Borealis.jpg']"
Finland,Northern Lights,"
For most people, seeing the Northern Lights is a once-in-a-lifetime treat. Finland is perhaps the top country in the world for seeing these blazing curtains of light drape across the sky. Although, at times, the lights can be seen even in the southern most regions of the nation, the best place to see them is in the region close to or north of the Arctic Circle. Here, between September and March, visitors are almost guaranteed a show if the sky is clear. A wide range of hotels in the north cater specifically to people wanting to see the lights. Also, the Finnish Meteorological Institute allows you to sign up for free Northern Lights email alerts.","['//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/aa/Polarlicht_2.jpg/600px-Polarlicht_2.jpg','//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d0/Virmalised_18.03.15_%284%29.jpg/622px-Virmalised_18.03.15_%284%29.jpg','//wikitravel.org/upload/shared//3/3c/Northern_Lights_Banner.jpg','//wikitravel.org/upload/shared//0/08/Aurora_finland.jpg','//wikitravel.org/upload/shared//b/bc/Sirkelovertoppene.jpg']"
Finland,Turku Castle,"
The southwestern Finnish town of Turku, the country's oldest town and until 1812 its capital, lies on the Gulf of Bothnia, at the mouth of the Aurajoki River. Turku lies in the area where the successors to the Swedish Vikings landed in the 12th century and set out to conquer what is now Finland. With eight centuries of history, it is today the most traditional medieval town in Finland, but in addition to its outstanding medieval buildings, you'll find examples of Art Nouveau and modern architecture, such as the Sibelius Museum, by Woldemar Baeckman. The river is a focal point for the city, lined with historic boats, some of which have been converted into restaurants. In the summer, locals gather along its banks in the evening and in the winter, it becomes a giant skating rink. On the northeast side of the river is the commercial center with the Kaupatori (market square) shopping center and lovely Orthodox Church. On the opposite bank the medieval cathedral, consecrated in 1290, rises above the Old Great Square. It is a massive brick church in Late Romanesque style with Gothic and Renaissance additions and a massive 97-meter-high tower, which dominates the city. During the midsummer Medieval Festival, the old square's ensemble of historic buildings regains its medieval air with craft stalls and food vendors. Just down from the cathedral along the river, two old sailing ships are moored ‚Äî the ""Suomen Joutsen,"" now a training school for seamen, and the ""Sigyn,"" the last remaining wooden barque used for sea trade. Both are open to the public in summer. Nearer the harbor is Turku Castle, built around 1300 on what was then an island at the mouth of the river. It was enlarged in the 16th to 17th century and now houses the Turku Historical Museum. For a look at what Turku looked like in the early 1800s, stroll through the streets of the Luostarinm√§ki Handicrafts Museum, an entire neighborhood of 40 homes, the only ones saved in the fire that destroyed Turku in 1827. Preserved as a museum village, its homes and workshops now house artisans who demonstrate period crafts.","['//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b8/Turkucastle_edit.jpg/640px-Turkucastle_edit.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2c/Turku_Castle_bailey.jpg/620px-Turku_Castle_bailey.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/da/Castle_of_Turku%2C_courtyard_renaissance_part.jpg/620px-Castle_of_Turku%2C_courtyard_renaissance_part.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/Castle_of_Turku%2C_larger_room.jpg/620px-Castle_of_Turku%2C_larger_room.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7f/Pulpit%2C_Turunlinna.jpg/690px-Pulpit%2C_Turunlinna.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3d/Turku_castle_inside_2.jpg/620px-Turku_castle_inside_2.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c6/Entering_the_Turku_castle.jpg/690px-Entering_the_Turku_castle.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e6/Turku_Castle_1.jpg/620px-Turku_Castle_1.jpg']"
Finland,Porvoo,"
The country's second oldest town, Porvoo, is 48 kilometers east of Helsinki. It rises from a picturesque riverfront lined with little red wooden buildings, through a charming tangle of old streets and ochre-colored wooden houses to its hilltop medieval cathedral. Highlights here are the ornate 1764 pulpit and wall paintings from the 15th century. Between the river and the hilltop cathedral is the Market Square with two museums worth visiting. One has exhibits on local history and the other, the Edelfelt-Vallgren Museum, is of particular interest to those fascinated by the Art Nouveau movement. It features the furniture, ceramics, and other works of several artists who formed an art colony here at the turn of the 20th century. Porvoo is still known for its fine crafts, so allow time for browsing the shops and studios. In the summer, you can visit Porvoo from Helsinki by boat.","['//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a1/Porvoo_in_January.jpg/650px-Porvoo_in_January.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cb/Porvoo_Old_Town_Hall.jpg/620px-Porvoo_Old_Town_Hall.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b6/Porvoon_Tuomiokirkko.jpg/620px-Porvoon_Tuomiokirkko.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/73/Barns_on_the_shore_of_the_river.jpg/620px-Barns_on_the_shore_of_the_river.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/09/View_from_N%C3%A4si_glacial_erratic_2.jpg/620px-View_from_N%C3%A4si_glacial_erratic_2.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/52/Porvoo_new_housing.jpg/620px-Porvoo_new_housing.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/11/Jackarby_Manor%2C_Borg%C3%A5%2C_Finland.jpg/620px-Jackarby_Manor%2C_Borg%C3%A5%2C_Finland.jpg']"
Finland,Castle Olavinlinna,"
The entire eastern portion of Finland is more sea than land. With literally tens of thousands of lakes, rivers, marshes, and ponds, eastern Finland is a fabulous aquatic playground. The dominant lake of the region is massive Lake Saimaa, the lake of a thousand islands. Lake Saimaa itself has an area of some 1,300 square kilometers ‚Äî excluding its numerous islands. The whole lake system is drained by the river Vuoksi, which leaves Lake Saimaa to the north of the town of Imatra and flows into Lake Ladoga in Russia. The hilly shores of the lake and most of the islands are almost entirely covered with coniferous forest, with some birch forest farther north. Savonlinna is the main city of Finland's lake region. A popular spa and holiday resort, Savonlinna grew up around Olavinlinna Castle, begun in 1475 and Europe's northernmost medieval stone fortress still standing. The castle, which has been beautifully restored, contains a number of handsome rooms, among them the King's or Knights' Hall, the Congress Hall, and the Great Hall. Three massive round towers have survived, and in one of them, the Church Tower, is a small chapel. In the Great Bastion is a summer caf√©. East of Savonlinna lies Kerim√§ki and the largest wooden church in the world. A must do when in the lake region are the boat cruises. From Savonlinna, there are boat trips to the other towns on Lake Saimaa, to Punkaharju, with the Retretti Art Center, the largest in the Nordic countries, to the monasteries of Uusi Valamo and Lintula. Another day trip option is a cruise down the Saimaa Canal to Vyborg in Russia on the Baltic Sea.","['//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/77/Olavinlinna_Savonlinna_Finland.jpg/665px-Olavinlinna_Savonlinna_Finland.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d0/Olavinlinna2.jpg/620px-Olavinlinna2.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/97/Olavinlinna_y%C3%B6valaistuksessa.jpg/657px-Olavinlinna_y%C3%B6valaistuksessa.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/91/Olavinlinna_Interior.jpg/657px-Olavinlinna_Interior.jpg']"
Finland,Hameenlinna,"
Like many Finnish towns, H√§meenlinna began near a castle, in this case the 13th-century Tavastehus Castle. Its distinctive red-brick fortifications top the list of places to see in Hameenlinna. The other place you shouldn't miss seeing is Aulanko Nature Reserve. Part garden park, part forest reserve, it is the first National Urban Park in Finland. The English-style park was constructed between 1883 and 1938, and in addition to hiking its well-kept trails among exotic and native trees, you can climb the 30-meter-tall granite tower on Aulangonvuori Hill for views across a typical Finnish forest and lake landscape. More than 50 different species of trees and shrubs are identified along the nature trail round Lake Joutsenlampi. Two historic pavilions and the ruins of a late 19th-century castle are also in the park. H√§meenlinna was the birthplace of the Finnish composer Jean Sibelius (1865-1957) and north of the market Square is the Sibelius Museum; a little bit farther on is the Sibelius Park and the nearby H√§meenlinna Historical Museum.","['//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c1/Lento_13.12.2007_070.jpg/650px-Lento_13.12.2007_070.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/03/Hameenlinna_Sibelius_House_1.jpg/620px-Hameenlinna_Sibelius_House_1.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5e/Hameenlinna_lake_vanajavesi.jpg/620px-Hameenlinna_lake_vanajavesi.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f4/October_sunset_-_H%C3%A4meenlinna.jpg/620px-October_sunset_-_H%C3%A4meenlinna.jpg','//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d6/Hameenlinna.JPG']"
Italy,Colosseum,"
For travelers making their way through Italy, the Colosseum is a must see. This huge Amphitheater is the largest of its kind ever built by the Roman Empire and has remained a model for sports facilities right up to modern times. Built as a venue for public spectacles and shows - even mock sea battles, it had a wooden floor that was 83 by 48 meters. Underneath it were two stories of tunnels, rooms, cells, and passages for gladiators, workers, wild animals, and storage. Today, the structure stands in stark contrast to the modern development that surrounds it and is a prominent reminder of ancient times and the extensive history of Rome.","['//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/53/Colosseum_in_Rome%2C_Italy_-_April_2007.jpg/650px-Colosseum_in_Rome%2C_Italy_-_April_2007.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d1/Roma06%28js%29.jpg/635px-Roma06%28js%29.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/74/Colosseo_2008.jpg/620px-Colosseo_2008.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/12/Colosseum_exterior%2C_inner_and_outer_wall_AvL.jpg/620px-Colosseum_exterior%2C_inner_and_outer_wall_AvL.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6b/Rome_%2829096723%29.jpg/620px-Rome_%2829096723%29.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/15/Photo_of_The_Colosseum_in_Rome%2C_Italy.jpg/640px-Photo_of_The_Colosseum_in_Rome%2C_Italy.jpg']"
Italy,Venice Canals,"
A gondola ride through the canals of Venice is a tradition that travelers have been enjoying for centuries. Venice is a city of islands, and the canals have long been the city's main streets, connected by a labyrinth of narrow passageways. Lining the canals are old buildings that have remained relatively unchanged for hundreds of years, adding to the romantic charm. The Grand Canal is the most famous of these waterways and one of the most photographed sites in Venice. The best way to see many of the grand palaces, whose fronts face the water, is from a Vaporetto ride along the Grand Canal.","['//i.pinimg.com/originals/55/5b/fa/555bfa0849ac8e663e83d53a30e6fbbe.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/51/View_of_the_Grand_Canal_from_Rialto_to_Ca%27Foscari.jpg/620px-View_of_the_Grand_Canal_from_Rialto_to_Ca%27Foscari.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ef/Canal_Grande_Panorama2.jpg/1076px-Canal_Grande_Panorama2.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1d/Canal_Grande_-_Venice%2C_Italy_-_April_18%2C_2014_04.jpg/763px-Canal_Grande_-_Venice%2C_Italy_-_April_18%2C_2014_04.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/af/Rialto_Gondoliers.jpg/658px-Rialto_Gondoliers.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/09/Venedig_panorama_Canale_Grande.jpg/610px-Venedig_panorama_Canale_Grande.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a3/1_venice_grand_canal_rialto_bridge_2012.jpg/870px-1_venice_grand_canal_rialto_bridge_2012.jpg']"
Italy,Pompeii,"
The still smoking volcano of Mt. Vesuvius looks down on the remains of the city it destroyed in AD 79. But that same eruption also preserved many of the city's art treasures: frescoes, mosaics, and sculptures that were encased in the lava as it cooled. Several centuries of excavations have revealed the remains of houses, markets, baths, temples, theaters, streets, and human remains. Visitors can tour the site, walk along the old streets scarred by the tracks of chariots, and see the engineering used by Romans more than 2,000 years ago.","['//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/58/Pompeii%26Vesuvius.JPG','//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/68/Pompeii_Forum.JPG', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bc/Pompeii_Garden_of_the_Fugitives_02.jpg/670px-Pompeii_Garden_of_the_Fugitives_02.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5a/Pompeii_-_Via_dell%27Abbondanza.jpg/620px-Pompeii_-_Via_dell%27Abbondanza.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3e/80045_Pompeii%2C_Metropolitan_City_of_Naples%2C_Italy_-_panoramio_%2818%29.jpg/620px-80045_Pompeii%2C_Metropolitan_City_of_Naples%2C_Italy_-_panoramio_%2818%29.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/34/Roman_fresco_Villa_dei_Misteri_Pompeii_006.jpg/620px-Roman_fresco_Villa_dei_Misteri_Pompeii_006.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b5/Ancient_Roman_Pompeii_-_Pompeji_-_Campania_-_Italy_-_July_10th_2013_-_31.jpg/620px-Ancient_Roman_Pompeii_-_Pompeji_-_Campania_-_Italy_-_July_10th_2013_-_31.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/68/Pompei_5058.jpg/620px-Pompei_5058.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/HouseOfTheFaunOverview.jpg/620px-HouseOfTheFaunOverview.jpg']"
Italy,Leaning Tower of Pisa,"
The Leaning Tower of Pisa is actually just one of many attractions in the city of Pisa, but its fame, gained from its flaw, is world renown. Work began on the tower in the 1100s, and the sinking, which led to the lean, began by the time the tower reached the third story. Prior to restoration work in the 1990s, it was predicted to topple over by the year 2000. Today, visitors can climb up the stairs of the tower for a fabulous view over the city. The Leaning Tower, also known as La Torre Pendente, stands on the Piazza dei  Miracoli, a setting it shares with the beautiful Romanesque Cathedral of Santa Maria Assunta and a round freestanding baptistery. Each of these features outstanding works of medieval stone carving.","['//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/66/The_Leaning_Tower_of_Pisa_SB.jpeg','//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/83/Torre_di_Pisa_-_panoramio_%2818%29.jpg/620px-Torre_di_Pisa_-_panoramio_%2818%29.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c3/Pisa_Leaning_Tower_bell.jpg/690px-Pisa_Leaning_Tower_bell.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4f/Pisa_Cathedral_%26_Leaning_Tower_of_Pisa.jpg/708px-Pisa_Cathedral_%26_Leaning_Tower_of_Pisa.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f7/Leaning_tower_loggiati.jpg/625px-Leaning_tower_loggiati.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6f/Leaning_tower_staircase_6th_floor.jpg/625px-Leaning_tower_staircase_6th_floor.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e4/Leaning_tower_of_pisa_2.jpg/625px-Leaning_tower_of_pisa_2.jpg']"

Lake Como is one of Italy's most scenic areas, surrounded by mountains and lined by small picturesque towns. A haunt of the wealthy since Roman times, the lake has many opulent villas and palaces along its wooded shores, many of them surrounded by gardens that are open to the public. The mild climate that makes the lake shore ideal for gardens is also a draw for tourists, with characteristics similar to that of the Mediterranean. Along with the resort towns around the lake, there's an 11th-century abbey.","['//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cc/Sentiero_del_Viandante_DSC_6340_%2814020554463%29.jpg/650px-Sentiero_del_Viandante_DSC_6340_%2814020554463%29.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b1/Varenna_Italy%2C_waterfront_at_sunset.jpg/620px-Varenna_Italy%2C_waterfront_at_sunset.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/92/Villa_Balbianello_on_Como_Lake_8.jpg/620px-Villa_Balbianello_on_Como_Lake_8.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c3/View_of_Lake_Como_from_Villa_Monastero%2C_Varenna.jpg/620px-View_of_Lake_Como_from_Villa_Monastero%2C_Varenna.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1b/Tremezzo%2C_giardini_pubblici_%28Ian_Spackman_2007-007-0-%29.jpg/620px-Tremezzo%2C_giardini_pubblici_%28Ian_Spackman_2007-007-0-%29.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6a/Good_como_lake_photo.jpg/620px-Good_como_lake_photo.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f2/Lago_de_Como%2C_Italia%2C_2016-06-25%2C_DD_02-06_PAN.jpg/1000px-Lago_de_Como%2C_Italia%2C_2016-06-25%2C_DD_02-06_PAN.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8b/LagoComoMemorial.jpg/1000px-LagoComoMemorial.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0a/LagoComoCarlotta.jpg/1000px-LagoComoCarlotta.jpg']"

Italy,Capri,"
The Blue Grotto is one of the most visited spots in all Italy, but there are other reasons for taking the short boat ride from Naples, Sorrento or the Amalfi Coast to the fabled Isle of Capri. The steep rocky island juts from an intensely blue sea, its craggy cliffs softened by green pines and tropical plants. The Blue Grotto is only one of the sea caves that cut its cliffs, and the best way to see these, along with the three signature rocks off the south coast known as the Faraglioni, is on a boat tour around the island. Several villas and gardens are open to tourists, and walking trails invite exploration. From almost anywhere on the island you can be certain of a good view.","['//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/06/Capri_Centre_Belvedere.jpg/660px-Capri_Centre_Belvedere.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/23/%D0%9A%D0%B0%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%B8_%D0%A0%D1%83%D0%B8%D0%BD%D1%8B_%D0%92%D0%B8%D0%BB%D0%BB%D1%8B_%D0%AE%D0%BF%D0%B8%D1%82%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B0.jpg/620px-%D0%9A%D0%B0%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%B8_%D0%A0%D1%83%D0%B8%D0%BD%D1%8B_%D0%92%D0%B8%D0%BB%D0%BB%D1%8B_%D0%AE%D0%BF%D0%B8%D1%82%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B0.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/32/Capri_BW_2013-05-14_16-04-44_DxO.jpg/620px-Capri_BW_2013-05-14_16-04-44_DxO.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/82/Villa_Behring_on_Capri.jpg/620px-Villa_Behring_on_Capri.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5d/Grotta_azzurra.jpg/620px-Grotta_azzurra.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/06/Capri_Centre_Belvedere.jpg/620px-Capri_Centre_Belvedere.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9e/Grotta_Meravigliosa_Capri.jpg/670px-Grotta_Meravigliosa_Capri.jpg']"
Switzerland,The Matterhorn,"
The Matterhorn, Switzerland's iconic pointed peak is one of the highest mountains in the Alps. On the border with Italy, this legendary peak rises to 4,478 meters, and its four steep faces lie in the direction of the compass points. The first summiting in 1865 ended tragically when four climbers fell to their death during the descent. Today, thousands of experienced climbers come here each summer. At the foot of this mighty peak, lies the charming village of Zermatt, a top international resort with horse-drawn carriage rides, quaint chalets, and world-class restaurants and hotels. To preserve the air quality and peaceful ambiance, motorized vehicles are banned in the village. In the winter, skiers can schuss down more than 300 kilometers of slopes. In the summer, swimming and tennis are popular pursuits as well as hiking, biking, and climbing in the surrounding mountains. Summer glacier skiing is also available.","['//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/60/Matterhorn_from_Domh%C3%BCtte_-_2.jpg/685px-Matterhorn_from_Domh%C3%BCtte_-_2.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6e/Matterhorn_from_Klein_Matterhorn.jpg/670px-Matterhorn_from_Klein_Matterhorn.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/26/Banner_clouds.jpg/620px-Banner_clouds.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f5/PanoramaMatter.jpg/700px-PanoramaMatter.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/14/Hauteroute_crop.jpg/600px-Hauteroute_crop.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d7/East_face_crop.jpg/600px-East_face_crop.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ca/Matterhorn002.jpg/620px-Matterhorn002.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/09/2007_Matterhorn.jpg/670px-2007_Matterhorn.jpg']"
Switzerland,Jungfraujoch: The Top of Europe,"
One of the most popular things to do in the beautiful Bernese Oberland is the train journey to Jungfraujoch, the Top of Europe, with an observation terrace and scientific observatory perched at 3,454 meters. The longest glacier in Europe, the Great Aletsch Glacier begins at Jungfraujoch, and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The famous Eiger Trail from the Eiger glacier station to Alpiglen clings to the rocks at the foot of the north face. Other popular walks include Panorama Way to the sunny, south-facing First slope; the Gletscherschlucht (Glacier Gorge); and √ñpfelch√ºechliw√§g, the high-altitude trail from Holenstein to Brandegg through fields of flowers, alpine pastures, and woodlands. The less active can ride gondolas and cable cars to scenic viewpoints over the Lauterbrunnen Valley. Picturesque Grindelwald is a glacier village in the Jungfrau region, which makes a great base for adventures into the surrounding mountains. It nestles at the base of snow-cloaked mountains and is one of Switzerland's oldest and most popular resorts. Towering above this alpine valley is the tiara-shaped Wetterhorn and the sheer north face of the Eiger, one of the planet's most dramatic and difficult climbs. Between the mountains lie Grindelwald's two glinting glaciers. For the best views, Faulhorn, at 2,681 meters, offers breathtaking panoramas of the giant peaks.","['//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d7/Jungfrau03.jpg/685px-Jungfrau03.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c4/2008_Jungfrau.jpg/620px-2008_Jungfrau.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bd/Jungfrau_Konkordiaplatz.jpg/620px-Jungfrau_Konkordiaplatz.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/15/Jungfrau_ascent.jpg/670px-Jungfrau_ascent.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bc/M%C3%A4nnlichen.jpg/630px-M%C3%A4nnlichen.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2f/Muerrenbahn-02.jpg/670px-Muerrenbahn-02.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f4/Jungfrau_from_Jungfraujoch.jpg/620px-Jungfrau_from_Jungfraujoch.jpg']"
Switzerland,Interlaken,"
Nestled between Lake Thun to the west and Lake Brienz to the east, Interlaken is one of Switzerland's most popular summer holiday resorts. In the center of town, H√∂hematte is a marvel of urban planning with 35 acres of open space. Flower gardens, hotels, and caf√©s surround the H√∂heweg, the main boulevard through here with breathtaking vistas of the mountains. The mighty peaks of the Eiger, M√∂nch, and Jungfrau tower above the town providing excellent opportunities for alpine adventures. Hiking, climbing, abseiling, and kayaking are prime pursuits. More than 45 mountain railways, cable cars, chairlifts, and ski lifts transport visitors into the surrounding countryside and offer plenty of chances for sightseeing from up above. In the winter, skiers and snowboarders can take their pick from the surrounding resorts and cross-country ski along the extensive trail network. In the summer, paragliders launch from Beatenberg-Niederhorn. To admire the scenery from lower elevations, hop aboard a paddle steamer for a cruise around the lakes.","['//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c4/Europe_Pictures_001.jpg/665px-Europe_Pictures_001.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4a/Interlaken_Street.jpg/670px-Interlaken_Street.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/da/Interlaken_01.jpg/670px-Interlaken_01.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/65/WasserwehrInterlaken.jpg/620px-WasserwehrInterlaken.jpg']"
Switzerland,Lucerne,"
Imagine a sparkling blue lake surrounded by mountains, a car-free medieval old town, covered bridges, waterfront promenades, frescoed historic buildings, and sun-splashed plazas with bubbling fountains. No wonder Lucerne (in German, Luzern) is a top spot for tourists. Famed for its music concerts, this quintessential Swiss town lures renowned soloists, conductors, and orchestras to its annual International Music Festival. The Culture and Convention Center is home to one of the world's leading concert halls. One of the city's most famous landmarks is the Chapel Bridge, built in the 14th century. In a small park, lies the famous Lion Monument, a poignant sculpture of a dying lion, which honors the heroic death of Swiss Guards during the attack on the Tuileries in the French Revolution. History buffs will enjoy the Swiss Transport Museum with extensive exhibits on all forms of transport, including air and space travel, railroad locomotives, and a Planetarium. For beautiful views of Lucerne, the Alps, and the lake, ride the funicular to the Dietschiberg on the north side of Lake Lucerne; cruise up Mt. Pilatus on the cableway; or head to the Rigi, a famous lookout point.","['//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3e/Lucerne_city%2C_lake_and_mountains.jpg/620px-Lucerne_city%2C_lake_and_mountains.jpg','//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/04/Lucerne_collage.png', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/29/Lucerne_reflections.jpg/620px-Lucerne_reflections.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/96/Swissporarena_luftaufnahme_cropped.jpg/620px-Swissporarena_luftaufnahme_cropped.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/70/Lucerne%27s_Jesuit_Church_at_Sunset.jpg/630px-Lucerne%27s_Jesuit_Church_at_Sunset.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/17/L%C3%B6wendenkmal_tourists.jpg/630px-L%C3%B6wendenkmal_tourists.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a2/Picswiss_LU-03-24.jpg/630px-Picswiss_LU-03-24.jpg','//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f9/Luzern_by_Horst_Michael_Lechner.jpg','//i.pinimg.com/originals/c7/7c/2b/c77c2b6156e033c754e314e2822ed40b.jpg']"
Switzerland,Lake Geneva,"
Lake Geneva, Europe's largest Alpine lake, straddles the Swiss/French border, and laps at the shores of some of Switzerland's most popular cities. The city of Geneva (in French Gen√®ve; in German Genf) sits between pretty snow-capped peaks at the point where the Rh√¥ne spills into Lake Geneva. This French-speaking capital of peace is the European seat of the United Nations and exudes a pleasing blend of French joie de vivre and Swiss structure. Promenades, parks, and gardens surround the lake, and the old town is a lovely spot to stroll among the historic buildings. The Jet d'Eau, a fountain in Lake Geneva shooting water 150 meters into the air, is a famous landmark. Cultural attractions include the Opera House and the Grand Th√©√¢tre, which stages international acts. Also on the lake, about 62 kilometers from Geneva, Lausanne boasts lovely views over the surrounding region and the lake, with the Alps rising in the distance. Take a stroll through the medieval old town with its cute caf√©s and boutiques and stunning Gothic cathedral. At the foot of the Alps, on Lake Geneva, Montreux hosts the world-famous Montreux Jazz Festival in June/July.","[ '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/76/View_over_Lake_Geneva_1.jpg/670px-View_over_Lake_Geneva_1.jpg',, '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/37/Lake_Geneva_with_Vineyards_in_Lavaux.jpg/620px-Lake_Geneva_with_Vineyards_in_Lavaux.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b3/Ile_de_Peilz.jpg/670px-Ile_de_Peilz.jpg','//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/27/Lac_L√©man_entre_Glion_et_Caux.JPG/600px-Lac_L√©man_entre_Glion_et_Caux.JPG','//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c5/Lake_Geneva_from_Lavaux.jpg']"
Switzerland,Chillon Castle,"
On the shores of Lake Geneva, near Montreux, the Chateau de Chillon (Chillon Castle) has inspired artists and writers for centuries. Lord Byron, Jean Jacques Rousseau, and Victor Hugo are among the luminaries who have written about this architectural treasure. Once the stronghold of the Counts and Dukes of Savoy from the 12th century, the complex encompasses about 25 buildings clustered around three courtyards. Highlights include the Great Halls, with magnificent views of Lake Geneva; the Gothic underground rooms; the Chapel, adorned with 14th-century paintings; and the Camera Domini, a bedroom occupied by the Duke of Savoy decorated with medieval murals.","['//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/61/Castle_of_Chillon_N.jpg/640px-Castle_of_Chillon_N.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f2/Ch%C3%A2teau_de_Chillon_mit_Autobahn-IMG_0823.jpg/697px-Ch%C3%A2teau_de_Chillon_mit_Autobahn-IMG_0823.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f7/Schweiz_Schloss_Chillon_Gesamtansicht.jpg/680px-Schweiz_Schloss_Chillon_Gesamtansicht.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/92/Ch%C3%A2teau_de_Chillon_-_Montreux.jpg/667px-Ch%C3%A2teau_de_Chillon_-_Montreux.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bb/Basement-of-chillon-castle.jpg/680px-Basement-of-chillon-castle.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8f/Grand_Hall_of_the_Count.jpg/674px-Grand_Hall_of_the_Count.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bc/Ch%C3%A2teau_de_Chillon_Innenhof_2008.jpg/657px-Ch%C3%A2teau_de_Chillon_Innenhof_2008.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/14/Ch%C3%A2teau_de_Chillon_video.webm/674px-seek%3D4-Ch%C3%A2teau_de_Chillon_video.webm.jpg']"
