delhi,Jama Masjid,"
One of the largest mosques in India, Jama Masjid is situated in Old Delhi. Its construction was started in 1644 and completed by Mughal emperor Shah Jahan. Made of red sandstone and marble, this gorgeous mosque is also called Masjid-I-Jahanuma, meaning the mosque commanding the view of the world. The courtyard of the mosque has been built with red sandstone and can be accessed from the north, the south and the east, via flights of stairs that were once venues for house markets, food stalls and entertainers. The courtyard is so huge that it can easily accommodate 25,000 devotees at one time. Jama Masjid has been built on an elevation of 10 m and has three gates, two 40-m-high minarets and four towers. From the tower, one can get a splendid view of bustling streets of Old Delhi.
The mosque houses many relics of Prophet Mohammad and draws devotees from far and wide. Some of these relics include a Quran written on deerskin, sandals and a footprint of the Prophet embedded in a marble slab, and a red hair, which is said to have been from his beard.
Jama Masjid was designed by Ostad Khalil, a renowned Mughal architect. Legend has it that the eastern gate of the mosque was meant for the royal family in the olden days.
The best time to visit the mosque is during the festivities of Id-ul-Fitr and Id-ul-Zoha, when it is resplendent as a bride and is thronged by devotees from all over the country.
It is said that Lutyens incorporated the mosque into his design in such a way that the mosque along with Connaught Place and the Parliament House falls in direct line of sight. Tourists are not allowed in the mosque during prayers and while the entry is free, one will have to pay for carrying a camera into the premises.","['//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Jama_Masjid_-_In_the_Noon.jpg/300px-Jama_Masjid_-_In_the_Noon.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/65/Jama_masjid_dilli6.jpg/220px-Jama_masjid_dilli6.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e2/Jama_Masjid_Panorama.jpg/500px-Jama_Masjid_Panorama.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bb/Jama_Maszid.jpg/500px-Jama_Maszid.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/21/Detail_of_the_arches_inside_Jama_Masjid%2C_Delhi.jpg/92px-Detail_of_the_arches_inside_Jama_Masjid%2C_Delhi.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/50/Mesquita_Jama_Delhi.jpg/120px-Mesquita_Jama_Delhi.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/b/bf/OldMosqueStepss.jpg/79px-OldMosqueStepss.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/05/Courtyard%2C_Jama_Masjid%2C_Delhi_%2801%29.jpg/120px-Courtyard%2C_Jama_Masjid%2C_Delhi_%2801%29.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0e/Jama_Mosque_Old_Delhi%2C_full_view.jpg/120px-Jama_Mosque_Old_Delhi%2C_full_view.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/22/Sundial_Jama_Masjid%2C_Delhi.jpg/120px-Sundial_Jama_Masjid%2C_Delhi.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7c/Janamaz-prayer--mat.jpg/90px-Janamaz-prayer--mat.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/74/A_kind_of_lamp_in_jama_masjid.jpg/90px-A_kind_of_lamp_in_jama_masjid.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/64/Jama-masjid-delhi.jpg/90px-Jama-masjid-delhi.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a6/Sun_Clock_at_Jama_Masjid_Delhi.jpg/120px-Sun_Clock_at_Jama_Masjid_Delhi.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8a/Oriental_Scenery_Fig_1.jpg/120px-Oriental_Scenery_Fig_1.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/77/Jama_Masjid%2C_Delhi.jpg/85px-Jama_Masjid%2C_Delhi.jpg']"
delhi,Akshardham,"
Holding the Guinness World Records as the world's largest comprehensive Hindu temple, the Akshardham temple complex is a stunning piece of architecture. Sprawled over a vast area, the complex looks like a splendid heavenly city when viewed from above. The temple itself has been constructed in pink sandstone and marble and is laid amidst neatly manicured lawns, pristine waterfronts and open courtyards. It has been designed in the traditional Hindu style of architecture and follows vaastu shastra and pancharatra shastra. As you stroll along the breathtaking complex, you will spot intricate carvings of animals, flowers, dancers, musicians and deities that adorn the walls. It is said that the stone used in the construction of the temple was brought from Rajasthan and weighed about 6,000 tonne. The Italian Carrara marble used in the structure adds to the beauty of the grand temple.
Some interesting features of the temple are a musical fountain, the Sahaj Anand Water Show at Yagnapurush Kund and the breathtaking Light and Sound Show. Starting at 7:30 pm, the show narrates stories from ancient Hindu scriptures. It is a spectacular rendition that uses colourful lasers, underwater flames, water jets and video projections.
The temple stands at a height of 140 ft and has a width of about 300 ft. It hosts 234 beautifully carved pillars, along with nine elaborately inscribed domes. The temple premises hold around 20,000 idols of Hindu deities, and the main shrine is that of Lord Swaminarayan. An 11-foot-tall idol of the god stands below the central dome. Interestingly, each statue at Akshardham is built with five metals called panch dhaatu. It also contains 148 statues of elephants that weigh over 3,000 tonne.
The temple can be accessed via 10 gates that symbolise 10 directions. The main gate is Bhakti Dwar or the gate of devotion. Akshardham was inaugurated on November 6, 2005. More than 8,000 volunteers across the world joined hands in building the temple.","['//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c2/New_Delhi_Temple.jpg/220px-New_Delhi_Temple.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/33/Akshardham_Dome.jpg/220px-Akshardham_Dome.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8c/Akshardham_fountain.jpg/220px-Akshardham_fountain.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Akshardham_Lotus.jpg/220px-Akshardham_Lotus.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/98/Akshardham_Delhi_Ricky_W.jpg/220px-Akshardham_Delhi_Ricky_W.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/29/Akshardham_construction.jpg/220px-Akshardham_construction.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c2/New_Delhi_Temple.jpg/75px-New_Delhi_Temple.jpg']"

delhi,Qutub Minar,"
Almost as old as the history of the Delhi Sultanate, the iconic Qutub Minar, the world's tallest brick minaret, dominates the skyline of the city. Standing 73 foot tall, this five-storeyed tower, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, remains one of the most magnificent buildings of India from the medieval era. The first three storeys of the tower are built in red sandstone while the fourth and fifth are made of marble and sandstone. All the five floors are adorned with projecting balconies.Located in Delhi's Mehrauli area, the Qutub Minar was commissioned by Qutub-ud-din Aibak, who laid the foundation of Mamluk dynasty (1206-1290) in India. Inspired by the victory tower at Ghazni, Afghanistan, its construction began in 1192 AD but, unfortunately, Qutub-ud-din-Aibak, did not live long enough to witness its completion. The tower was finally completed by his successors Iltutmish and Firoz Shah Tughlaq.Another attraction here is the Quwwat-ul-Islam Mosque that stands right next to the minaret. Constructed by Qutub-ud-din-Aibak, the mosque is considered to be the first building in the Qutub complex that houses a number of monuments. One of the most popular among these is the Iron Pillar, also known as the Ashoka Pillar, which dates back to the 4th century. Standing around 24 ft high and weighing more than six tonne, the pillar is famous for its high resistance to corrosion. It is a popular belief among tourists visiting the complex that if you can encircle the pillar with your arms while standing with your back to it, any wish you make will be fulfilled. An example of this can be seen in a scene from Hindi movie Cheeni Kum, which starred legendary actor Amitabh Bachchan.Tourists can also visit the Alai Darwaza, which is a domed gateway built with red sandstone and adorned with white marble inlays. Built by Allauddin Khalji, this grand monument stands as a testament to the craftsmanship of the skilled Turkish artisans who built it. In close proximity stands the Alai Minar, commissioned by Alauddin Khalji, who wanted it to be twice as high as the Qutub Minar. Unfortunately, the construction of the tower was stalled following the death of Khalji in 1316. Today, a giant rubble masonry of the tower's first storey can be seen at the spot, which was intended to be covered with a layer of stone. The tomb of Iltutmish was built by the emperor himself and was one of the first tombs to be built in Delhi.Tourists can also head to the Mehrauli Archaeological Park that houses the final resting place of Ghiyas-ud-din Balban, who was once the ruler of the Delhi Sultanate. In the Qutub complex lies the Jamali Kamali Mosque and a tomb of a Sufi saint. The three-day Qutub Festival, held in the months of November and December, features classical dance and music, and is real crowd puller.","['//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c0/Qutb_Minar_2011.jpg/200px-Qutb_Minar_2011.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2a/Kuttull_Minor%2C_Delhi._The_Qutb_Minar%2C_an_aquatint_by_Thomas_Daniell%2C_1805.jpg/220px-Kuttull_Minor%2C_Delhi._The_Qutb_Minar%2C_an_aquatint_by_Thomas_Daniell%2C_1805.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fc/KITLV_377921_-_Clifton_and_Co._-_The_Qutab_Minar_in_Mehrauli_in_Delhi_-_Around_1890.tif/lossy-page1-220px-KITLV_377921_-_Clifton_and_Co._-_The_Qutab_Minar_in_Mehrauli_in_Delhi_-_Around_1890.tif.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3d/Qutub_Minar_764.jpg/220px-Qutub_Minar_764.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8f/Qutub_Minar_932.jpg/120px-Qutub_Minar_932.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b2/Calligraphy_on_Qutb_Minar_as_seen_from_bottom_up.jpg/90px-Calligraphy_on_Qutb_Minar_as_seen_from_bottom_up.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b8/Qutub_Minar_07.jpg/90px-Qutub_Minar_07.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/05/Details_of_the_balcony%2C_Qutub_Minar.jpg/120px-Details_of_the_balcony%2C_Qutub_Minar.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f7/Qutb_Minar_views.jpg_12.jpg/90px-Qutb_Minar_views.jpg_12.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/49/Smith%27s_Cupola%2C_Qutb_Minar%2C_Alai_Darwaza_and_Tomb_of_Imam_Zamin%2C_Qutb_Complex_-_1.jpg/120px-Smith%27s_Cupola%2C_Qutb_Minar%2C_Alai_Darwaza_and_Tomb_of_Imam_Zamin%2C_Qutb_Complex_-_1.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bf/Plaque_at_Qutub_Minar.jpg/96px-Plaque_at_Qutub_Minar.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/38/2018_Qutub_Minar_New_Delhi.jpg/90px-2018_Qutub_Minar_New_Delhi.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ea/Qutb_Minar_path_view.jpg/82px-Qutb_Minar_path_view.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/65/Old_Buildings_in_Qutb_Minar_Campus.jpg/120px-Old_Buildings_in_Qutb_Minar_Campus.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/87/Jain_Ruins_at_Qutub_Minar.jpg/107px-Jain_Ruins_at_Qutub_Minar.jpg']"
delhi,Red Fort,"
Lying at the heart of Delhi, the majestic Red Fort, made of fine red sandstone, stands as a testament to the architectural legacy of the Mughals. One of the most beautiful monuments in the world, this UNESCO World Heritage Site, famous as qila-e-mubaraq, is replete with palaces, pavilions and mosques.
Built by Mughal emperor Shah Jahan as the palace fort of his capital Shahjahanabad, Red Fort is famous for its massive enclosing walls. The architecture of the fort reflects a seamless fusion of Islamic, Persian, Timurid and Hindu styles. The major attractions are the Diwan-i-khas, also known as the Shah Mahal, the Diwan-i-aam or the Hall of Public Audience and the Rang Mahal (a part of the harem), also known as Imtiyaz Mahal. The other monuments here are the Naubat Khana (Drum House), where royal musicians played and announced the arrival of royal family members; the hammam (royal bath), and the Muthamman Burj, or Musaman Burj (a tower where the emperor would show himself to his subjects). Once the power of the Mughals weakend, the fort was plundered by the Persians, led by Nadir Shah, in 1739. The invaders took away much of the fort's treasures, including the opulent Peacock Throne, which Shah Jahan had crafted out of gold and gemstones (including the precious Kohinoor diamond).
Besides the monuments, a major draw for tourists today is Son et Lumiere, a sound and light show, which is held every evening. The enchanting one-hour long show traces the Mughal empire's history in India and offers a glimpse of their glorious past as well as the eventful phases that led to their downfall. The narration has been recorded by legendary actor Amitabh Bachchan, which makes the show absolutely engaging.
The entrance to the fort is through the Lahore Gate that leads to the shopping area called Chatta Chowk. The Chowk, an arched passageway which used to house royal tailors and merchants, is lined with stores selling ethnic handicrafts and apparels from different parts of the country. Not many know that the Red Fort also houses several military barracks, which were raised by the British. Made in red and white sandstone, the barracks stand as fine specimen of colonial architecture and one is instantly smitten by their old world charm. Dating back to 1857, the barracks were built to house the British army after it had dethroned Bahadur Shah Zafar, the last Mughal emperor. After the British reign ended, the barracks were used to house Indian Army personnel and it was only in 2003 that the Army vacated them. Today, some of these barracks have been turned into museums and art galleries, with the support of the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI).
The fact that the Indian Prime Minister hoists the National Flag from the ramparts of the Lahore Gate every year on Independence Day, makes the Red Fort among the most significant monuments of the country. Its innovative planning and brilliant architecture has inspired a number of monuments in Rajasthan, Delhi and Agra as well.
A visit to the historic fort offers a quintessential experience of the bygone era of Delhi.
The fort's construction was completed over a span of 10 years (1638-48). It once overlooked the Yamuna river, which has moved away over the course of time. Historians also suggest that a tree-lined waterway, which was called nahr-i-bihisht or river of paradise, ran out of the fort and its water was sourced from the Yamuna.Lying at the heart of Delhi, the majestic Red Fort, made of fine red sandstone, stands as a testament to the architectural legacy of Mughals.

delhi,India Gate,"
A stunning archway standing as a tribute to the brave soldiers who sacrificed their lives for the country, India Gate is one of the landmarks of Delhi. Built with sandstone, this 42-m-high gate was the first of its kind in the national capital. The walls of the gateway have been inscribed with the names of 13,516 soldiers killed in the Northwestern Frontier in the Afghan war of 1919, besides 90,000 soldiers of the Indian Army who were martyred in World War I. The base of the monument is made of red Bharatpur stones and the structure of India Gate is similar to France's Arc- de- Triomphe.
India Gate is fringed by lush well-maintained lawns that act as a popular picnic venue for families. The best time to visit this monument is at night when it is bathed in soft golden lights and glistens in the dark star-less sky.
The foundation stone of this grand monument was laid by the Duke of Connaught in 1921 and it was designed by Edwin Lutyens. A decade later, the monument was dedicated to India by the then viceroy, Lord Irwin.
Amar Jawan Jyoti, made of marble, is located in front of India Gate and was constructed in the year 1971. It was built to pay tribute to the brave soldiers who lost their lives during the Indo-Pak War in December 1971. The flame is guarded by uniformed soldiers and a shining rifle crowned by an army helmet has also been kept near it.
India Gate also plays host to the awe-inspiring Republic Day Parade, when the President lays a wreath on the Amar Jawan Jyoti. After this, a grand parade is held along Rajpath and you can see contingents, tanks, vibrant floats, weapons all being conducted in a neat file. School children and folk dancers join the parade and add a cultural touch to the whole affair.","['//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/09/India_Gate_in_New_Delhi_03-2016.jpg/200px-India_Gate_in_New_Delhi_03-2016.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f5/India_Gate_in_1930s.jpg/220px-India_Gate_in_1930s.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/17/India_Gate_from_Rajpath.jpg/220px-India_Gate_from_Rajpath.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2e/Inscription_on_India_Gate.jpg/500px-Inscription_on_India_Gate.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/52/Canopy_behind_India_Gate.jpg/200px-Canopy_behind_India_Gate.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ef/Amar_Javan_Jyoti.jpg/200px-Amar_Javan_Jyoti.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/81/India_Gate%2C_New_Delhi_at_Night.jpg/300px-India_Gate%2C_New_Delhi_at_Night.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8c/India_Gate_on_an_evening.jpg/338px-India_Gate_on_an_evening.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0f/India-gate-names.jpg/412px-India-gate-names.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9c/Indian_Armed_Forces_flags.jpg/338px-Indian_Armed_Forces_flags.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f0/Defense.gov_photo_essay_120606-D-BW835-022.jpg/338px-Defense.gov_photo_essay_120606-D-BW835-022.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f5/Russian_Defence_Minister_Sergei_Shoigu%27s_official_visit_to_India_%2807%29.jpg/338px-Russian_Defence_Minister_Sergei_Shoigu%27s_official_visit_to_India_%2807%29.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/33/A_Mass_Run_against_Drug_Abuse%2C_on_the_occasion_of_the_International_Day_Against_Drug_Abuse_and_Illicit_Trafficking%2C_at_India_Gate%2C_in_New_Delhi_on_June_26%2C_2011.jpg/191px-thumbnail.jpg']"
delhi,Rashtrapati Bhawan,"
The official residence of the President of India, Rashtrapati Bhawan is the most prominent landmark of Delhi. Built in the Edwardian baroque style of architecture, the building is adorned with classical motifs that symbolise legacy and authority. Rashtrapati Bhawan is spread over an area of 321 acre and boasts 340 rooms, including guest rooms, reception halls, offices, stables and residences for staff and bodyguards.
Rashtrapati Bhawan was constructed in 1929 and is also called Presidential Residence and Viceroy's House. Earlier, it was the residence of British viceroy. This architectural marvel was constructed in 17 years. Rashtrapati Bhawan was designed by Edward Lutyens and Herbert Baker. The famous Mughal Gardens of the Bhawan are spread over 15 acre of land and has 159 varieties of roses, 60 varieties of bougainvillea and many other varieties of flowers. The Rashtrapati Bhawan Museum Complex (RBMC) also makes for an interesting visit. A major highlight is an old Presidential buggy that can be seen drawn by life-size horses. You can also admire a Mercedes car gifted to the former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi by the king of Jordan. To get a closer look at history, tourists can see rare photographs of the Bhawan and the freedom movement that have been displayed on a table. A Gift's Counter in the premises shows the presents received by the President from different parts of the world. Tourists would be particularly entranced by a special square box that has 3-D holographic images, which are played alongside the speeches of various Presidents.

Much before the political heads of the country, Mahatma Gandhi visited Rashtrapati Bhawan in 1931, when he was invited by Lord Irwin wherein he took a pinch of salt with him as a mark of protest against the British. The meeting finally ended in the Gandhi-Irwin Pact of 1931.","['//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fe/Forecourt%2C_Rashtrapati_Bhavan_-_1.jpg/240px-Forecourt%2C_Rashtrapati_Bhavan_-_1.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f4/View_of_Rashtrapati_bhavan.webm/220px--View_of_Rashtrapati_bhavan.webm.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3e/Viceroy%27s_House_India_old.jpg/220px-Viceroy%27s_House_India_old.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9c/View_of_rashtrapati_bhawan.jpg/220px-View_of_rashtrapati_bhawan.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b1/Indian_President%60s_Bodyguard_marching_at_Rashtrapati_Bhavan.jpg/220px-Indian_President%60s_Bodyguard_marching_at_Rashtrapati_Bhavan.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/22/Rashtrapati_Bhavan_flank_perspective1.jpg/220px-Rashtrapati_Bhavan_flank_perspective1.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/64/Rashtrapati_Bhavan-4.jpg/220px-Rashtrapati_Bhavan-4.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/50/Canon_outside_the_entrance_to_Rashtrapati_Bhawan%2C_Delhi.jpg/220px-Canon_outside_the_entrance_to_Rashtrapati_Bhawan%2C_Delhi.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7e/Jaipur_Column_from_west_with_north_block_at_Rashtrapati_Bhawan.jpg/220px-Jaipur_Column_from_west_with_north_block_at_Rashtrapati_Bhawan.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/02/Rashtrapati_Bhavan_gate_close_up.jpg/220px-Rashtrapati_Bhavan_gate_close_up.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ca/President_Barack_Obama_is_presented_with_a_scarf_by_Rayapati_Sambasiva_Rao.jpg/220px-President_Barack_Obama_is_presented_with_a_scarf_by_Rayapati_Sambasiva_Rao.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e9/Fountain_near_the_Indian_President%27_residence.jpg/220px-Fountain_near_the_Indian_President%27_residence.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9b/Mughal_gardens_fountain_.jpg/220px-Mughal_gardens_fountain_.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/46/Mughal_gardens_tulips.jpg/220px-Mughal_gardens_tulips.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/70/Rashtrapatibhavan.jpg/220px-Rashtrapatibhavan.jpg']"
mumbai,Bhandardara,"
A beautiful village nestled amongst the vast and green hilly ranges of the Western Ghats, Bhandardara is a trekker�s paradise. With its bright blue skies, green paddy fields, cascading waterfalls and surrounding blue-green hills, this quaint hamlet acts as a perfect retreat for families seeking to escape the bustle of the city for a long weekend. Located at a distance of about 185 km from Mumbai, Bhandardara lies to the north of Ahmednagar district. The Wilson Dam in Bhandardara and its adjoining Arthur Lake, add to the scenic beauty of the village and provide some good camping opportunities for adventure-seekers and astronomy enthusiasts. A circular waterfall called the Umbrella Waterfall because of its distinctive shape, can be seen forming at the dam during the rainy season. There are many cosy resorts in Bhandardara that offer glorious views of the dam and the lake. Another highlight of this region is the majestic 2,000-year-old Ratangad Fort, which has a distinctive natural rock formation at the very top with an arch-like cavity that overlooks the valley below. The four gates of this fort called Ganesh, Hanuman, Konkan and Trimbak are noteworthy.
 The availability of water at this height, once made this fort precious to Chhatrapati Shivaji. There are many wells in the fort and the River Pravara, on which the Wilson Dam is built, also originates from this fort. A trek up the ramparts of the fort gives you a bird's eye view of the entire Bhandardara region. The village at the base of this fort, Ratanwadi, can be accessed by boat from Bhandardara. The main attraction in the village is the Amruteshwar Temple that dates back to the 8th century. This ancient Shiv temple draws many tourists annually, both pilgrims and those who are archaeologically-inclined.","['//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/db/Arthur_Lake.jpg/250px-Arthur_Lake.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/b/b9/Bhandardara_Village.jpg/220px-Bhandardara_Village.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/64/Bhandardara_dam.jpg/220px-Bhandardara_dam.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/46/Amriteshwar_temple.jpg/220px-Amriteshwar_temple.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/58/Umbrella_falls_bhandardara.jpg/220px-Umbrella_falls_bhandardara.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7e/Bhandardara_dam_1.jpg/220px-Bhandardara_dam_1.jpg']"
mumbai,Elephanta Caves,"
One of the best things about Mumbai is the sea and the access it provides for quick day-time trips to nearby beaches and islands. Less than an hour's boat ride from the Gateway of India, in Colaba, lies the Elephanta Island colloquially known as Gharapuri or the Fortress City. The scenic island stretches across 10 to 15 sq km of land and has a dense foliage of mango, tamarind and palm trees. Perfect for a weekend excursion, this island provides good trekking as well as picnic opportunities. The island gets its name from a giant stone sculpture of an elephant that was discovered by the 16th century Portuguese explorers who came to this area. The island owes its global popularity to the fact that it is home to a network of ancient rock-cut caves known as the Elephanta caves that boast artistic wall carvings and sculptures, dedicated to Hindu and Buddhist gods. These caves were incorporated in the UNESCO list of World Heritage sites in the early 1980s. The walls of the caves, which are located on top of a hillock, are lined with rock art that experts say, dates as far back as the mid- 5th and 6th century. There are two main hills on the island � Gun Hill and Stupa Hill. The former gets its name from the two British-era canons perched on it and the latter because of the remains of a Buddhist stupa that was excavated here. The most intricately detailed and architecturally majestic cave, among the Elephanta network is situated on Gun Hill. The panels on these caves depict the lives and beliefs of the esoteric Pashupati sect of the Shaiva system. A 7-m-high sculpture called Sadashiva lies at the entrance of the cave.","['//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d9/Elephanta_Caves_Trimurti.jpg/220px-Elephanta_Caves_Trimurti.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cd/India_relief_location_map.jpg/250px-India_relief_location_map.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d8/Elephanta_1.jpg/200px-Elephanta_1.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c7/Cave_of_Elephants_1905.jpg/200px-Cave_of_Elephants_1905.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/be/Elephanta_Elephant.jpg/220px-Elephanta_Elephant.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7c/Elephanta_Cave_figures_drawing.jpg/240px-Elephanta_Cave_figures_drawing.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ca/KITLV_92158_-_Unknown_-_Temple_in_a_cave_at_Elephanta_in_India_-_Around_1875.tif/lossy-page1-240px-KITLV_92158_-_Unknown_-_Temple_in_a_cave_at_Elephanta_in_India_-_Around_1875.tif.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/00/Map_of_Elephanta_Island.jpg/330px-Map_of_Elephanta_Island.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c0/Shiva_linga_in_elephanta_cave_in_west_side.jpg/220px-Shiva_linga_in_elephanta_cave_in_west_side.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4d/Elephanta_Caves_Panorama.jpg/200px-Elephanta_Caves_Panorama.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/aa/Grottes_d%27Elephanta_-_pilliers_de_la_grotte_principale.jpg/200px-Grottes_d%27Elephanta_-_pilliers_de_la_grotte_principale.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/96/Trimurti%2C_Cave_No._1%2C_Elephanta_Caves_-_1.jpg/220px-Trimurti%2C_Cave_No._1%2C_Elephanta_Caves_-_1.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/30/Ardhanari%40_Elephanta_Caves.jpg/220px-Ardhanari%40_Elephanta_Caves.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/20/Shiva_slaying_Andhaka.jpg/170px-Shiva_slaying_Andhaka.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c2/Yogishvara_Lord_of_Yoga_Shiva_at_Elephanta_Cave_1.jpg/170px-Yogishvara_Lord_of_Yoga_Shiva_at_Elephanta_Cave_1.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1f/Shiva_Nataraja%2C_grotte_d%27Elephanta_%28Mumbai%2C_Inde%29%2C_Cave_1.jpg/220px-Shiva_Nataraja%2C_grotte_d%27Elephanta_%28Mumbai%2C_Inde%29%2C_Cave_1.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/55/Elephanta_caves_pic.jpg/150px-Elephanta_caves_pic.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cd/La_grotte_de_Shiva_%C3%A0_Elephanta_%28Mumbai%2C_Inde%29%2C_Cave_1.jpg/200px-La_grotte_de_Shiva_%C3%A0_Elephanta_%28Mumbai%2C_Inde%29%2C_Cave_1.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/50/Shiva_Linga_shrine_in_Elephanta_Caves.jpg/200px-Shiva_Linga_shrine_in_Elephanta_Caves.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f0/Grottes_d%27Elephanta_-_Sanctuaire_de_la_grotte_principale.jpg/220px-Grottes_d%27Elephanta_-_Sanctuaire_de_la_grotte_principale.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ee/Elephanta_caves3.jpg/200px-Elephanta_caves3.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e8/Elephanta_Stupa_Hill_and_Buddhist_monuments.jpg/120px-Elephanta_Stupa_Hill_and_Buddhist_monuments.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d9/Elephanta_Cave_No_6.jpg/203px-Elephanta_Cave_No_6.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/94/Elephanta_Cave_6_Plan.jpg/207px-Elephanta_Cave_6_Plan.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8b/Brahma_statue_%286th_century_CE%29.jpg/170px-Brahma_statue_%286th_century_CE%29.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9f/Elephanta_tourists.jpg/170px-Elephanta_tourists.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/34/Train_in_elephanta_caves.jpg/177px-Train_in_elephanta_caves.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ef/Thane_Creek_and_Elephanta_Island_03-2016_-_img12_Elephanta_Island_ferry.jpg/200px-Thane_Creek_and_Elephanta_Island_03-2016_-_img12_Elephanta_Island_ferry.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/21/India_statue_of_nataraja.jpg/100px-India_statue_of_nataraja.jpg']"
mumbai,Matheran,"
When in Mumbai, you can head to one of India's smallest and most quaint hill stations, Matheran, for a quick weekend getaway. One of the coolest spots in the Karjat Tahsil, Raigad District of Maharashtra, it is located in the Western Ghats. Matheran literally means forest on top or woodland overhead and the name aptly fits the 800-m-high hill town. The interesting thing about Matheran is that vehicles are banned here and one can easily be transported to the quaintness and peace of times long ago while vacationing at this spot. It's proximity to major cities makes it a more viable option. 
It lies about 90 km from Mumbai, 120 km from Pune and about 320 km from Surat. This pocket in the hills was discovered in 1850 by the then British Collector of Thane, Huge Mallet.
The Kalavantin Durg or Fort near Matheran is a perfect day time trek option. You can lose yourself in the wilderness of the fort, which is located at an elevation of over 2,000 ft. The most striking aspect of this ancient structure is the series of rock-cut steps that snake up to the top. The panoramic view from the pinnacle has to be seen to be believed.","['//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bc/Matheran-map.jpg/250px-Matheran-map.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/50/Matheran_India_Map_1911.jpg/220px-Matheran_India_Map_1911.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/84/Louisa_Point_Matheran.jpg/200px-Louisa_Point_Matheran.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fd/MatheranHS4.jpg/374px-MatheranHS4.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/87/MatheranHS5.jpg/118px-MatheranHS5.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/80/MatheranHS2.jpg/374px-MatheranHS2.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3f/MatheranHS3.jpg/374px-MatheranHS3.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9b/MatheranHS7.jpg/374px-MatheranHS7.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6d/Matheran_Hillstation_8.jpg/118px-Matheran_Hillstation_8.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e6/Sunset_point_in_Matheran1.jpg/280px-Sunset_point_in_Matheran1.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/98/Matheran_Hillstation_1.jpg/118px-Matheran_Hillstation_1.jpg']"
mumbai,Vasai Fort,"
The city of Mumbai lies on the coastline of Maharashtra and to protect it, many forts were constructed in its long history. One of those is the Vasai Fort, also known as Bassein Fort, significant militarily to oversee the surrounding areas of Mumbai, Thane and Saashti. Located in the Vasai suburb of North Mumbai, the walls of the fort, though in ruins, still have enough in them to make you wonder at its architectural marvel. Due to its strategic location, the fort has witnessed many battles. It was under the control of the Portuguese army till the early 18th century. The Maratha kingdom, under the leadership of Bajirao Peshwa, waged a few battles to claim it for their own. After the initial unsuccessful attempt in 1737 to capture Vasai, the Maratha leader Chimajiappa, was handed over this task. A lot of research and reconnaissance went into planning the next attack and after a swift and well-planned guerilla campaign, the Maratha army finally captured the fort in 1739. The remnants of chapels, watchtowers and staircases in the ruins of this fort under the cover of large palm trees tell many stories from that time period. Because of its history as a Portuguese settlement, there are a few graves with carvings in Latin and remains of an ancient church that can also be seen. The ramparts, arches and watchtowers are hauntingly beautiful and many visitors prefer to shoot their wedding photos here. The wild overgrown vegetation as well as coconut and palm tree cover adds to the beauty of the wilderness. There are a few trails that let you go up to the edge of the fort from where gorgeous views of the Ulhas river and the setting sun can be seen. The fort has also been used as a location for many Bollywood films like Josh,� Khamoshi and Ram Gopal Verma Ki Aag.","['//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/93/Vasai_fort_building2.jpg/300px-Vasai_fort_building2.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/aa/Chimaji_Appa_Statue_01.jpg/220px-Chimaji_Appa_Statue_01.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a9/Main_entrance_to_the_Citadel_at_Vasai_Fort.jpg/220px-Main_entrance_to_the_Citadel_at_Vasai_Fort.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7f/Vasai_Fort_Panorama_01.jpg/220px-Vasai_Fort_Panorama_01.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/44/Bassein_Fort_entrance.jpg/220px-Bassein_Fort_entrance.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/43/Vasai_fort_building.jpg/220px-Vasai_fort_building.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/37/Vasai_fort_facade.jpg/220px-Vasai_fort_facade.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f0/Chimaji_Appa_Memorial_01.jpg/220px-Chimaji_Appa_Memorial_01.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8d/Baobab_Tree_at_Vasai_Fort.jpg/90px-Baobab_Tree_at_Vasai_Fort.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3f/A_grasshopper_at_the_fort.jpg/120px-A_grasshopper_at_the_fort.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c2/Baby_Caterpillers_feeding_on_leaves_at_the_fort.jpg/120px-Baby_Caterpillers_feeding_on_leaves_at_the_fort.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7a/Wild_Flowers.jpg/90px-Wild_Flowers.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/51/Spider_having_lunch.jpg/120px-Spider_having_lunch.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/38/Beatutiful_grasshopper.jpg/120px-Beatutiful_grasshopper.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/df/Eurasian_Hoopoe_at_the_Bassein_Fort.jpg/120px-Eurasian_Hoopoe_at_the_Bassein_Fort.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bf/Unidentified_Agamidae_at_Bassein_fort.ext.jpg/97px-Unidentified_Agamidae_at_Bassein_fort.ext.jpg']"
mumbai,Karnala Bird Sanctuary,"
A popular stopover for birdwatchers, the Karnala Bird Sanctuary lies at a distance of about 52 km from Mumbai. The biodiversity of the Western Ghats makes it a great habitat for birds and the sanctuary was especially favoured by renowned Indian ornithologist Dr Salim Ali. Its proximity to the Patalganga river and the richness of the woodland vegetation ensures that this park boasts an extremely diverse flora and fauna with over 150 species of resident and 37 species of migratory birds, which visit the sanctuary in winter each year. Around 23 water dishes made of cement are kept at strategic places to provide water to animals and birds. The Hariyal Nature Trail in the sanctuary offers great bird-sighting experiences, especially during the monsoon. For those seeking a more in-depth insight into the fascinating life of birds, the 6-km-long Mortaka Trail is an amazing spot with its fascinating array of bird and butterfly life. Apart from the many hiking trails and picnic spots, this sanctuary is also known for the Karnala Fort that rests on top of the hills. Located at an altitude of 445 m above sea level, this fort was built in the 12th century as a vantage point to govern the trade route between Bhor Ghat (a mountain passage in the Western Ghats) and Mumbai. At the bottom of the funnel hill of the fort there are 12 water storage tanks built with basalt rock to collect and retain rain water all around the year. The Karnala Bird Sanctuary is home to exotic bird species like the peregrine and shikra and also invites many trekkers who come here to escape the city and soak in the tranquility and isolation of this region.","['//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9e/Karnala_006.jpg/284px-Karnala_006.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6e/Karnala_bird_santuary_1.jpg/120px-Karnala_bird_santuary_1.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5a/Karnala_bird_santuary_2.jpg/120px-Karnala_bird_santuary_2.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7a/Birds_of_Karnala_Bird_Sanctuary%2C_District_Raigad%2C_Maharashtra.pdf/page1-220px-Birds_of_Karnala_Bird_Sanctuary%2C_District_Raigad%2C_Maharashtra.pdf.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7a/Birds_of_Karnala_Bird_Sanctuary%2C_District_Raigad%2C_Maharashtra.pdf/page1-220px-Birds_of_Karnala_Bird_Sanctuary%2C_District_Raigad%2C_Maharashtra.pdf.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7a/Birds_of_Karnala_Bird_Sanctuary%2C_District_Raigad%2C_Maharashtra.pdf/page1-220px-Birds_of_Karnala_Bird_Sanctuary%2C_District_Raigad%2C_Maharashtra.pdf.jpg', '//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/03/Butterflies_of_Karnala_Bird_Sanctuary_Kasambe_BIONOTES_2016.pdf/page1-220px-Butterflies_of_Karnala_Bird_Sanctuary_Kasambe_BIONOTES_2016.pdf.jpg']"
